<b>[1] 2007 HLT-NAACL</b>

<p>
<b>Status of the conference as of the Exec meeting</b>
<p>

437 (32 workshop-only) had registered, with an estimate of 475
eventual registrations, which is a decline from last year's 689. (The
number of submissions seemed about on par with those last year; the
number of workshops was down whereas ACL was oversubscribed with
workshop submissions.)  Business Manager Priscilla Rasmussen was
therefore pulling back from a 500-person break-even budget to a
400-person break-even budget (e.g., reduce internet service from a
$5000 to a $3000 plan).  On the other hand, Google provided an
unexpectedly large amount of $2500 in the previous week.  The general
sense was that the early timing of the conference, rather than the
location, was the probable cause of the decline.  There was discussion
of whether May or October would be better, with some thinking that a
2009 ACL in August in India would imply a 2009 NAACL in May.  Other
possibilities were the fact that this year's timing was back-to-back
with ICASSP, or that grant funding might not have been finalized this
early, suggesting late October as a possibility (early October is not
good for government folks, since they wouldn't have a travel budget
then).  Scheduling for 2009 needs to take into account EACL 09,
thought to be either April 27-May 1 or March 27-April 1.

<p>

A GALE meeting this year caused the full-papers submission deadline
for to HLT-NAACL be pushed later.

<p>
<b>Short papers</b>
<p>
The NLP Program Chair Matthew Stone noted that short papers seem to
need different treatment, since they seem to attract different
audiences and/or interact with other conferences' deadlines in
interesting ways, and this has potential implications for the
structure of the conference.  There was a good representation of IR
papers among the full (notification deadline pre-SIGIR), but not the
short, papers; the situation was the exact reverse for speech
(deadlines in October).

<p>

<b>Conference organization: observations and proposals</b>
<p>
Matthew Stone found the triumvirate organization unwieldy, both
because of the different loads mentioned above, and because of the
overhead triggered (since more people were involved in decision
making).  A checklist of advice would include having a meeting by
phone once a week, and having certain tasks (such as the creation of
area sub-committees, where only one person might have the relevant
expertise) have the decision-making delegated to a single person,
although in practice, one person often seems to become "the leader"
anyway.  Strong words were used to express the opinion that untenured
people should not be asked to serve as program co-chairs, and that
candidate co-chairs need to be informed of the workload up-front.

<p>

One suggestion was to have the NLP person be the first among equals
(is the NLP person generally more involved in the conference itself as
it forms part of the basis of his/her own personal research
community?).  Or how about two NLP co-chairs?  But perhaps more
important than one person being in charge is figuring out a way to
allow people to contribute easily; part of issue is people
coordinating when it is they need to do what.  Specific problems:
getting reviewers for speech during Interspeech; determining the *two*
invited speakers (which in part means we need to invite PC Chairs much
earlier).  On a related note, perhaps no main PC chair is needed for
speech, given that there were almost no full-paper submissions?
Indeed, should the area split be handled through area chairs/senior PC
members rather than at the program chair level, with the advisory
board asked for advice for the selection of senior PC members when
necessary?  It was strongly suggested that the senior PC should not
have to handle the short papers, especially since the reviewing is
supposed to be different for these papers and the same reviewers
aren't likely to switch evaluation criteria.

<p>

Also, demos and publications didn't make sense as an 3-area
triumvirate.  That is, we could have had three people, but they
needn't have been from different areas.  Indeed, publications is three
people's worth of work, and could use extra secretarial support as well;
whereas for sponsorships and exhibits, a triumvirate simply was not
set up.

<p>

It would be beneficial to have a list of recommended START-system
settings (such as were used by a recent EMNLP), instructions for how
to carry over the full paper "apparatus" to the short-paper reviewing;
and previous review forms; this could perhaps all enter the Conference
Handbook or the archives.  It might also be useful to have NAACL offer
support, e.g., for a graduate-student in HLT to be able to check for
double submissions (a task that it does not seem an administrative
assistant could handle).  We designated a sub-committee for thinking
about reviewing procedures and software: Regina Barzilay, Jennifer
Chu-Carroll, Lillian Lee, and the three PC chairs.

<p>
<b>Handing down past experience</b>
<p>

General chair Candy Sidner has requested "lessons learned" summaries
from various organizers [These reports have been placed in the 2007
section of the NAACL archives], and suggests that there be an NAACL
version of the ACL Conference Handbook, and that lessons learned be
passed along. [Note that prior conference reports are available at the
NAACL archives.]  This suggestion was later refined by ACL Business
Manager Priscilla Rasmussen to a "supplemental handbook to the ACL
Handbook for NAACL meetings", which would perhaps highlight deviations
from ACL policy and NAACL-specific items, and would perhaps
specifically mention defaulting to ACL policy in the relevant
places.  It was also suggested that organizers at all levels be
reminded to check the NAACL archives.

<p>

<b>Visa issues for conference attendees.</b>
<p>

One Italian prospective conference attendee was denied a visa, perhaps
because of a citizenship issue, but despite supporting letters from
the conference organizers.  The organizers contacted the office of a
U.S. Senator from New York State, to no avail.  Visa problems have
been an issue for the AAAI and for previous NAACL speakers, as well.
Upon review, it does not appear that different timing or a different
letter would have solved the problem.  There was some speculation that
visa problems have actually eased recently.

<p>

Suggestions for the future for conference attendees: inform authors
(via the conference webpage and other means) that that these problems
can arise, and suggest that although the organization can try to help,
authors need to: act early; try to identify alternate presenters who
could give the paper in their stead; and inform senior PC members (who
can inform session chairs) if they haven't received a visa within one
or two weeks of presentation date.  There was some discussion of
whether having reserved (just-in-case) papers makes sense: on the
positive side, this means that unexpectedly open slots (visa problems,
illnesses) can be filled; on the minus side, this may force
reserve-slot authors to incur travel costs perhaps unnecessarily, and
might send an inadvertent signal that people sometimes choose not to
attend the conference.

<p>

Suggestions for the organization: check into how companies get
expedited visa handling; consider collaborating with other scientific
organizations; bring the issue to the attention of the ACL, who may be
the body for whom the ultimate responsibility should lie.

<b>[3] The 2008 meeting, joint with ACL in Columbus, with a Coordinating
   Committee involved. </b> 
<p>

(See also the conference-organization notes above.)

<p>

We discussed the question, "How much do we want ACL 2008 to feel like
an NAACL?" The aspects we discussed were: 1) outreach to speech/IR; and
2) the short-paper track.  The claim was made that people find the ACL
poster sessions less interesting than the HLT late-breaking papers
session.  The NLP program chair for this year's NAACL, Matthew Stone,
felt that the triumvirate structure (speech, IR, NLP) was unwieldy.
(See also discussion of the short-papers track in the 2007 meeting,
described above.)  At any rate, if there are doubts in the NAACL's
mind regarding the triumvirate structure, it's not clear that we
should ask the ACL to conform to it.  The group agreed that we should
support having short papers at the meeting.

<p>

Some discussion of whether the 2008 meeting should have the HLT name
ensued.  The upshot seemed to be that the group didn't have strong
feelings about the matter.

<p>
<b>Proposals for ACL 2008 follow</b>
<p>

Some suggested having two PC chairs, and having a separate short-papers
committee with two chairs also; but there was strong opposition to
this, with the counter-suggestion to keep the Speech PC chair.  The
eventual recommendation was to have the IR and the speech PC chair
handle both long and short submissions, to have an NLP PC chair handle
long submissions, and another NLP PC chair handle short submissions,
with the reminder that the advisory board serves as a resource, and
the clarification that short papers go in a separate volume, and the
suggestion that short-paper and demo reviewing could be combined.

<p>

Getting the names of the senior PC on the call for papers would be
good, since this helps to show the areas that we're interested in.

<p>

Policy decision: PC chairs, up to three local chairs, and conference
chairs receive free registration in recognition of their contributions.

<b>[4] Advisory board</b> 
<p>

As of the meeting, Jeff Reynar had agreed to join, and Donna Harman
was working on getting an official response from SIGIR regarding an
official rep.  There was some discussion of how much input the
advisory board should "officially" have into the ACL meeting next
year, of how different areas should be balanced with respect to
representation on the advisory board, and of whether
non-North-American entities, such as ELRA or AFNLP (who runs IJCNLP)
could be contacted, although ACL Treasurer Kathy McCoy noted that
there can be trouble with what kinds of entities can receive funds of
various kinds of origins.  The final decision was to stick with a
North American board for now, but suggest that the ACL think about
expansion beyond this.

<a name="Treas-rpt"></a>
<b>[5] Treasurer's report </b> 
<p>

The report is archived [see the NAACL archives].  At the time,
HLT-NAACL 2004 accounting had been finished after about two Sundays'
worth of time, but ACL 2005 accounting had not been completed by the
ACL Treasurer yet.

<p>

There was a quick reminder that the North American Computational
Linguistics Olympiad had not put an acknowledgment of NAACL funding on
its webpage, but this was presumably an oversight.

<p>

Fund-raising possibilities discussed: recruiting sessions, awards,
and/or student luncheons that companies might want to sponsor; or,
bundled "sponsorship packages" to make sure the funds can also be used
towards general expenses (if companies are willing to buy into such
packages; there was some doubt in this regard).  NAACL Chair Owen
Rambow suggested that in order to not compete with ACL and ACL
sub-organizations, fundraising should be coordinated across the
"*ACL"s, with perhaps two-year coordinating positions to allow for the
cultivation of personal relationships with industry contacts.  One
committee possibility would be a global position, plus a chapter
position, plus a local position.  Exec Member Bill Dolan and Owen
Rambow decided to form part of a committee to deal with these issues.

<p>

Then, discussion turned to ways to use our surplus. One option that
was discussed was resource creation, such as software and data
repositories or archives. (However, it was noted that it could be
difficult for industry folks to get licenses, and that licensing
issues are important with respect to good relations with industry.
Thus, a repository would probably need to articulate different levels
of permissions.) It was also noted that the patent and trade office
looks at or uses the ACL anthology.  There was some sentiment that we
shouldn't fund items for which other funding sources exist, and that
we shouldn't put out an open proposal call.  Another option was to
alter the costs of conference attendance.

<p>
<a name="SLT"></a>
<b>[6] SLT</b> 
<p>

We discussed IEEE's new Spoken Language Technology workshop, SLT, and
IEEE's "semantic computing" initiative.  Board Member Mary Harper
suggested strengthening ties with ICASSP, a community whose use of
statistical techniques forms a natural bridge, and ICSLP, which is
more human-centered than the typical NAACL meeting tends to be.  Such
strengthening might consist of asking for recommendations for
advisory-board members, co-sponsoring conferences, co-announcing
things in newsletters, or joint discounts. Perhaps a similar arrangement
could be made with SIGIR.  In both cases, the "other" organization
could designate an advisory-board member as their representative.

<p>
<a name="Summer-schools"></a>
<b>[7] Summer schools</b> 
<p>

Linguistic Society of America (LSA): The NAACL sponsored 5
scholarships, and the ACL contributed as well.  The applicants
included 3 NAACL students and 50 from LSA students.  Potential reasons
for this imbalance: summer schools aren't part of the NAACL
community's tradition; the courses might have seemed too introductory
for students within the NAACL community; lack of advertising or poorly
timed advertising among the NAACL community. On the other hand, the
great response from the LSA side of things was quite welcome.  It
would be good to determine some way to streamline the application
process and the decision process, in a way that works with the
procedures the LSA already has in place.

<p>

Johns Hopkins summer school: The decision from last year was to
allocate $5K for this year, amounting to about $1K per student.  Last
year, different amounts of support were allocated to different
students on a (perceived) need basis. There was some question of
whether we couldn't have the allocation depend on the number of
worthy applicants, or specify a more loose target, such as "up to ten".
A committee was created to handle the JHU scholarship program,
consisting of Bill Dolan, Mary Harper, and Owen Rambow.

<b>[8] Miscellaneous topics</b> 
<p>

There may be some perception that NAACL is more applied than the ACL;
this has been expressed in reviews, for instance ("this is an ACL
paper, not an NAACL paper").

<p>

It was noted that workshops bring in money because they tend to result
in larger attendance.  Perhaps some workshops could be oriented more
towards outreach towards other areas.

<a NAME="genchairrep-start"></a><h4>HLT-NAACL 2006 General Chair's report</h4>

<p>Robert C. Moore, <br>October 17, 2006<br>

<p>
In general I thought the conference went well.  Attendance was close to 700 (Pricilla, of course, has the exact totals), which I believe makes it the best attended meeting sponsored by NAACL so far.  There were two major problems, both created by the conference hotel.  The first problem was that the hotel refused to make any more guest rooms available at the conference rate than the minimum number they guaranteed, even though they had rooms available.  What I expected, and what Priscilla confirmed is the usual practice, was that while they would not guarantee any more rooms than the contract called for, if more rooms were available, they would provide them to our attendees at the conference rate, which they refused to do.  The second problem was that, while we were verbally assured that we would have exclusive use of the meeting room space on the second floor of the hotel throughout the period of the conference, the hotel in fact booked several additional events that we had to work around.  While we had sufficient room for all our sessions, some of the competing events were quite noisy, which disrupted several of our sessions in adjacent space.  I suppose the lesson to be learned from this is to study hotel contracts very carefully, and make sure that all our expectations are explicitly spelled out.

<p>

A major innovation in 2006 was that the student research workshop (SRW) was replaced by a doctoral consortium, during which advanced graduate students were given an opportunity to present an abbreviated "job talk" and get feedback from a panel of senior figures in the field.  We decided to try this, because at the previous two HLT-NAACL conferences, the SRW received barely enough submissions to fill its sessions, allowing for almost no selectivity.  At HLT-NAACL 2004, the SRW received only 12 submissions, accepting 10.  The international ACL conferences, in contrast, always seem to generate much more interest in the SRW.  ACL-Coling 2006, for example, received 40 submissions to the SRW, of which 15 were accepted for presentation.  The switch to the doctoral consortium format at HLT-NAACL 2006 was successful in increasing submissions to 18, of which 10 were accepted.  I attended most of this event.  It seemed to me that almost all the students took it very seriously, and got useful feedback from the panel.  The costs of the event were covered by a combination of a grant from NSF and a donation from Microsoft.

<p>

HLT-NAACL 2006 followed the practice established in 2004 of having three co-chairs for most positions, one each from NLP, IR, and Speech.  We did this specifically for positions that dealt with the program (main program, tutorials, workshops, and demonstrations) and publicity.  The other positions, where it did not seem as important to have the full range of disciplines represented (sponsorship and exhibits, publications, local arrangements), we had at least two co-chairs, but we did not concern ourselves with disciplinary diversity.  As in 2004, we combined sponsorship and exhibits, since most exhibitors are in fact sponsors exercising the benefits of their sponsorship.

As far as I can tell, the basic mechanics of organizing the main program, workshops, and tutorials went smoothly.  The START conference management package seems to be working well for us, although I gather the vendor seemed somewhat overwhelmed by the extensive use we were making of it (including all the workshops), but I feel that is an issue for ACL to negotiate with him.

<p>
My impression is that the overall quality of accepted papers was quite high.  The acceptance rate was 25% for long papers and 41% for short papers, which appears to be in the sweet spot where the acceptance rate is low enough that quality of the presented papers is high, but high enough that there is not too much complaining about good papers being rejected.  There were 257 full paper submissions, which was many more than the 168 submitted in 2004, but much less than the 402 submitted to HLT-EMNLP 2005.  Since EMNLP is normally a separate conference from HLT, perhaps it is more appropriate to compare that 402 to the total of papers submitted to HLT-NAACL and EMNLP in 2006, which was 491 (257 + 234).  Viewed that way, the monotonic increase in paper submissions seems to be continuing, and we very well may see even more submissions to HLT-NAACL 2007, although the very early submission deadline may diminish that somewhat.

<p>

The distribution of papers remains heavily weighted towards NLP.  I don't have the exact numbers at hand, but my impression is that there is a healthy submission level of speech papers, and that HLT is beginning to be a venue of choice for certain speech-related topics, including language modeling and spoken-dialogue issues.  Getting significant numbers of IR-related submissions remains a challenge.
<p>
Handling of publications seemed to go particularly smoothly, thanks in large part to the high degree of automation that Jason Eisner developed for ACL 2005.  We briefly discussed going with CD-only proceedings, as at ACL-Coling 2006, but in the end decided against it.  I believe that it is only a matter of time before this becomes the norm, however.
<p>
I feel that there are two additional minor, but chronic problems that affected HLT-NAACL 2006.  One was the lack of clear lines of authority, which was noted by Julia Hirschberg in her 2004 conference report.  It is just not clear what the conference organizers can decide on their own, and what must be referred to the NAACL Exec, the HLT Advisory Board, or the ACL Exec.  This could be helped by drafting a specific HLT-NAACL conference handbook.  Trying to use the ACL conference handbook for HLT-NAACL leaves the organizers uncertain which references to the ACL Exec to interpret as meaning the NAACL Exec and which still mean the ACL Exec; and the HLT Advisory Board is nowhere mentioned.
<p>
Another problem that also seems to be chronic is appointing the conference organizers early enough.  In 2006 and again in 2007 the general chair was not selected nearly early enough to come anywhere close to meeting the timetable called for in the ACL conference handbook.  So, although everything did get done in 2006, much of it was at the last minute.  I would urge that the NAACL Exec and HLT Advisory Board try to appoint a general chair for one conference well before the preceding conference has occurred and before the contracts have been signed for the venue of his/her conference so he/she can play an active role in that area.  This means that if there is to be an HLT conference in 2008 (perhaps combined with EMNLP again), we should be working now (October 2006) to identify a general chair and a site.
