<b>[1] HLT/NAACL-2004 CONFERENCE</b> 

Julia Hirschberg reviewed the report (<a
href="#hltnaaclrep-start">excerpted below</a>) of the general
chair and sub-chairs for HLT/NAACL 2004.  She noted that all the
reports were in within one day of the announced deadline, and all but
one were in on time.  

Below are points not otherwise raised in the conference report.

-- About registration --

There was some discussion of the number of registrations this year,
and especially about whether and/or why the student registrations were
relatively low.  Kathy McCoy reported that there were a few
problematic registrations, including redundant registrations, possibly
caused by web-server delays being interpreted as failures.  It is
recommended to delete the "I'm a invited speaker and so don't have to
pay" option from the online registration form, since people were
confused as to what "invited speaker" status is.  Otherwise, online
registration was pretty smooth.


-- About the reviewing process for the main conference --

Of the 19 submissions that were rejected as long papers but invited to be
revised and re-submitted as short short papers, 5 were re-submitted.
There were fewer short-paper submissions than expected.  

Some reviewers felt they did not receive papers in their area of
expertise; this might be due to the flexibility of the Area Chairs
(which indicates that "Senior Program Committee" might be a better
name).

The START conference-review software allows conference chairs and
reviewers to see the identity of reviewers.  Cyberchair doesn't have
this property, but was not necessarily recommended.  START licensing
fess are approximately $500 for the first conference, $400 for the
second, and then $100 for each subsequent one.

-- About organization --

A general problem was that lines of authority weren't always clear.
For example, it had been generally assumed that the ACL Business
Manager or the ACL Treasurer set the fees, but instead, it turned out
to be the responsibility of the NAACL Treasurer.  A complicating
factor is that tradition and the ACL Conference Handbook (which is
ACL-meeting specific) interact in complex ways.  For instance,
according to the Handbook, co-located workshops are the responsibility
of the General Chair, but the Workshop Chair(s) might be a better
choice. Perhaps the Handbook could be "parametrized" for chapter
meetings, or could specify where latitude exists. Also, perhaps a
particular NAACL Executive board member could be designated as the one
in charge of keeping an eye on the conference, and determine
which questions need to be passed up to the ACL Executive.

One topic for consideration is how to better incorporate institutional
memory; one hurdle is that the chairs and sub-chairs all change every
year.  Perhaps, given the three-(sub)chair structure, one of the
chairs could serve as a co-chair for the following year.  

Another question was the status of a proposal making the sponsorship
chair a paid position that is filled by the same person from one year
to the next.

-- About the Student Research Workshop --

Funding for non-USA students to attend the Student Research Workshop
was a problem.  NSF may prefer USA students ("may" because it was
noted that for a AAAI spring symposium, NSF and ONR didn't seem to
distinguish USA from non-USA students).  The need to use US carriers
was a major problem.   One positive aspect was that the overhead on
the NSF funding was low, perhaps because of low overhead rates at the
institution involved (Ohio State).  IBM sponsored in full an evening
event.  

The submission rate was low.  Perhaps this is due to interactions with
the short papers of the main session.  One possibility would be to
funnel some rejected short-paper submissions to the Student Research
Workshop submission pool.

-- About the workshops --

There was much discussion about "exception" workshops, such as SIG
meetings and/or workshops that want different treatment from the
"standard" set-up (examples: meeting off-site, meeting at a different
day than the designated workshop days).  "Exception" workshops can
cause a great deal of overhead for organizers, especially because it
is currently unclear who is in charge of what and what policies apply
for such cases (examples: Who pays for catering?  Should a "register
for workshop X only" (and thus not paying the general-conference
registration fee) option be allowed?)

There were some problems with workshop organizers making up their own
schedules without having been told about the communal breaks schedule.

-- About local arrangements -- 

Christine Doran reviewed her report.

Negotiations with hotels and related entities were done before MITRE's
bid to host the meeting was approved because hotel costs had to be
submitted with the final bid materials.  No hotels of a suitable size
were to be found in Cambridge.  An advantage of dealing with a hotel,
rather than a very large venue, is that extra negotiating leverage
results from being a very big customer from the a hotel's point of
view.  In the end, a very good room rate was acquired (as evidence,
many people are staying extra nights beyond the conference; some did
complain and found alternate housing in hostels or the YMCA).  The
meeting substantially exceeded the room contract, and the hotel, being
very pleased with this threw in some extras.  A perk for those who
booked rooms through NAACL was that they could make free 800 and local
calls.  The central locale was a plus, although there were some
problems with traffic.  The hotel provided swan pins, subsequently
dubbed "swans of power" to those organizers who were authorized to
make decisions on the meeting's behalf to make the visually
identifiable to hotel staff.  This was a nice system, although it
provoked the question of whether there were one swan to rule them all.

Wireless hubs were purchased.

Because there were multiple speech demos, there was a need to give the
demos extra space. This required re-arranging the demo and poster
space.

The total budgeted cost for the banquet was $17310, for 400 people.
At the time, about 200 tickets, at $65 each, had been sold.

MITRE received some money for administrative support; in return, some
of their administrative staff helped out on site.  MITRE also set up a
"holding" account, which allowed for tax-exempt status to apply and
which made paying costs easier.

There was some confusion about who was authorized to sign contracts,
write checks, and so on (the NAACL Treasurer?  the General Chair?  the
Business Manager?). 


-- Other topics --

Because some of the tutorials had low pre-registration numbers, it
might be necessary to reduce the number of tutorials from 6 (two per area),
especially since it was observed that in general the number of people
who attend tutorials seems to remain constant.

Steven Bird, Dragomir Radev, and Sandra Carberry may have found a good
solution to the problem of the ACL website location.

Problems with Omnipress include the fact that they didn't handle the
arrangements for proceedings delivery well.

The integration of the three main areas could be improved.

<a name="min-acl"></a>
<b>[2] ACL 2005</b>

A reminder was given that although Dragomir Radev is NAACL Treasurer
and therefore in usual circumstances would be an ex-officio member of
the oversight committee for ACL 2005, because he is Local Arrangements
chair for that conference, he will not be on the oversight committee
to avoid conflicts of interest. 

Dragomir Radev reviewed his presentation for the business meeting.

At the time, preparation of the final budget and general-chair
selection were still in progress.

A point of discussion was whether to include a local, i.e., North
American, flavor to ACL 2005; an example would be a Latin American
panel.  It was suggested that someone spearhead whatever effort is
undertaken.

<a name="min-finance"></a>
<b>[3] NAACL FINANCIAL DATA</b>

The 2004 balance was $21.8K.  The Summer School cost $10K, and $4K
were received from ACL 2002 (this latter number had initially been predicted
to be higher).

<b>[4] BIDS FOR NAACL 2006</b>

Janyce Wiebe presented a draft of the preliminary call for bids for
review.  Possible locations were discussed.

<a name="min-schools"></a>
<b>[5] SUMMER SCHOOLS</b>

Reminder: This is the final year of the agreement between NAACL and
the Johns Hopkins CLSP summer school.  In review, it seems like an
expensive (approximately $1000 per student), but fruitful arrangement.

Approved: a proposal, with attendant conditions, for NAACL sponsorship
of the Linguistic Society of America's 2005 summer school.

<b>[6] POSITION ON AN HLT MEETING IN 2005</b>

Previous discussions on this topic were reviewed: the general question
was what role NAACL should play (advisory? financial? none?) with
respect to an HLT meeting in 2005, should one occur.  Scenarios
discussed included (a) HLT being co-located or co-organized with a
different meeting than ACL 2005, for example, CoNLL, IJCAI, or SIGDAT;
(b) the HLT meeting being a workshop at ACL 2005; and (c) ACL 2005 and
the HLT meeting co-locating.  These options could impact people's
perceptions of the HLT meeting's prestige and HLT tradition in
different ways.  Scenario (b) had the potential to raise the
"Exception Workshop" concerns discussed above (see "About the
workshops").  Advantages of (c), co-location, include maintaining a
positive influence on the integration of speech, IR, and CL;
disadvantages include organizational questions and conflicts of
deadlines.  It was also noted that in general, ACL treats co-located
entities as workshops, with ACL taking an overhead percentage, with
larger meetings paying a larger rate. [As of September 2004, option
(a), with SIGDAT, had been chosen.]

<a name="min-misc"></a>
<b>[7] MISC.</b>

Plans were made for what to say at the HLT-NAACL 2004 Business Meeting
--- announcement of election winners, solicitation of nominations from--
the membership at large, sundry thanks.

It was agreed that we would hold off on any constitutional issues
until June, when election business arises.  The nominating committee
should be contacted in the summer.

Another phone meeting will occur in late fall.

<a name="hltnaaclrep-overview"></a><b>General Chair Report</b>

Julia Hirschberg, Columbia

High Points:  
<ul>
<li>Conference registration numbers are good.
<li>We chose three chairs for each sub-chair position, one each from NLP, IR, and 
the Speech community.  This worked extremely well, since there was always 
backup when someone was traveling, and it spread the workload out.  I think it 
also gave more people a sense of involvement in the conference; e.g., 21 of the 27 
chairs are attending the conference.  All of the groups did first-rate jobs.  Christy 
and I are having a thank-you lunch to show our appreciation on Monday.
<li>The paper submission and selection process went relatively smoothly and the 
PC chairs and area chairs all recommend the Start review software they used to 
other ACL conferences.  Long paper decisions were made in a face-to-face 
meeting and short paper/poster decisions on a conference call.  The PC chairs 
chose area chairs who had expertise in multiple areas, to provide flexibility in 
case submissions did not follow the previous year's pattern, and this worked well 
in general.  The PC chairs and Area chairs decided to give a best paper award; in 
consultation with the NAACL board, we decided to do this, although this decision 
need not bind future PC committees.  43 of 168 full paper submissions were 
accepted (26%), and 40 of 84 short papers (48%).  While it was difficult to count 
the submissions by broad area, the PCs' best effort at doing this (which counts 
some papers in multiple categories) indicates that, for Long Papers, 129 were in 
NLP, 53 in IR, and 33 in Speech; for Short Papers, 47 were in NLP, 28 in IR, and 
27 in Speech.
<li>Student Workshop:  We did receive NSF funding ($20,164) this year to support 
the workshop, thanks to the efforts of the Faculty Advisors to the workshop.  One 
issue here is international students, since NSF is better able to support  U.S. 
students from U.S.; however, other options for support are available for foreign 
students, and future Advisors should explore them.  We also decided to hold the 
workshop during the tutorial day, so that there would be less competition from 
parallel paper sessions.   Finally, we decided to hold a student evening party 
instead of a lunch;  IBM agreed to sponsor.
<li>Tutorials:  We settled on six, 2 in each of our theme areas, IR, NLP, Speech.  As 
of the end of pre-registration, two workshops (one NLP and one Speech/IR) had 
rather low enrollments (12 and 8) but the rest were doing fine.  We decided not to 
cancel any assuming we would get walk-ins in Boston.
<li>Workshops:  We received 11 proposals and accepted 10.  As of 26 April, 
registration ranges from 19 (WS7 on Speech Indexing and Retrieval) to 60 (WS8 
on Linking Biological Literature, Ontologies and DBs).
<li>Demos:  There were 22 submissions of which 19 were accepted.  The demo chairs 
solicited other demos as well, but few of these solicited proposals resulted in 
demos.  We decided on a demo plenary session with 2 demos for presentation 
plus overviews of the rest by the demo co-chairs.  The actual demos will be given 
(in parallel) during the remainder of the session.
<li>Sponsorships:  We contacted 48 organizations and 8 publishers.  Of these, we 
received $25,000 from 10 sponsors/exhibitors, most at the 'Bronze' ($1,000) 
level.    We allowed Bronze sponsors free exhibit space on a one-time basis to get 
more exhibits.  Not many publishers (only ACM and MIT Press) wanted to 
exhibit this time.
</ul>

Low Points/Suggestions:  
<ul>
<li>Overall:  It was not always clear whom to ask and who had the final say when we 
wanted to innovate or to find out standard practice where this was not specified in 
the ACL Conference Handbook.  It would be good to clarify whether the NAACL 
Exec or the HLT conference board (or the ACL exec) should be contacted for 
different matters, or to specify which contact person in each the General Chair 
should deal with.  This was particularly an issue wrt the Best Paper Award issue, 
the naming of Area Chairs (the PC chairs wanted to call them Senior Program 
Committee members), policies on co-located workshops (e.g. SigDial), and many 
budget issues.  We got lots of help from lots of people, but if experts and 
designated contact people could be specified in advance, it would be helpful.  
<li>Budget and fees:  Over the years, responsibility for preparing the conference 
budget and setting fees has been shared among the various conference chairs and 
the treasurer of the ACL or chapter.  This needs to be clarified in the ACL 
Conference handbook.
<li>Tax-exempt payments:  A section should be added to the handbook about the 
desirability of handling payments for the conference through some tax-exempt 
organization.  Christy and I had assumed that ACL was tax exempt and so 
originally were not budgeting for tax; we are now hopefully getting Mitre to 
handle payments since they are tax-exempt in Massachusetts.
<li>Registration: Holding the conference in early May may have lessened the 
number of students who could attend.  However, there were problems getting a 
good hotel later.   It is possible that this is a reason for the low submissions to the 
Student Workshop.  However, despite considerable efforts to advertise and 
encourage submissions, only 12 (9 NLP and 3 IR or Speech) papers were 
submitted, out of which 10 (7 NLP; 3 other) were accepted.  This is a problem.
<li>Website:  ACL needs to move its website to a commercial hosting service; this 
was a problem when we started registration.  In general, the conference handbook 
needs to be clarified about all web issues wrt conferences.  In addition, I would 
recommend that any workshop that wants internet access should be able to get it, 
without paying for it itself.  This is 21st century :).
<li>Co-located but non-ACL-run workshops:  ACL and NAACL have developed 
certain practices over the years in dealing with co-located workshops.  It would be 
very helpful to have the sections in the conference handbook updated to reflect 
these and that future general chairs follow them strictly.  Future conferences 
should offer to workshops two choices:  either the workshop conforms completely 
to ACL workshop guidelines or it is completely on its own.  In addition, it would 
be useful to make liaison with such conferences part of the Workshop Chair's 
duties.  There is too much duplication of effort otherwise.  This would require a 
change to the Handbook.
<li>Publications:  Things went pretty smoothly despite several last minute changes,  
one workshop getting its proceedings in very very very late, and Omnipress mis-
numbering the Companion volume (they reprinted the TOC to match their 
numbering to fix this).  The Publications Chairs handled all this extremely calmly.    
If others have similar problems, perhaps future conferences might want to find 
another press?  Also, the publications software we now use needs better 
documentation in order to take advantage of some of its features.  This should be 
an action item on perhaps for the NAACL exec.
</ul>

<a name="hltnaaclrep-loc"></a><b>Local Arrangements Chair Report</b>

Christine Doran, Mitre Corp, cdoran@mitre.com

MITRE was solicited for a bid to host HLT/NAACL 2004, and to the best of my 
knowledge, our bid was the only one submitted. From the beginning, we were clear that 
we wanted a downtown event, which meant a hotel, and the board expressed two major 
concerns with that plan, based on previous problems with having the meeting in a hotel. 
First, the cost of the hotel rooms, as Boston is an expensive city, and second, the issue of 
committing to a block of hotel rooms.

We considered four hotels in downtown Boston, the Sheraton, the Park Plaza, the 
Marriott and the Westin. The Park Plaza offered the best room rate ($169 when we 
started negotiations) and after the site visit, there was a clear consensus that this hotel 
would be the best fit for us, in terms of size, prize, location, amenities and character. 
After quite a few rounds of negotiations, we agreed to a block of 1090 rooms at 
$139/night for singles and $144 for doubles, and paid a token $1500 for all of our 
meeting spaces.  As of this writing, we have booked 1364 room nights.

The main downside with using a hotel was that we had to reserve our meeting spaces well 
in advance of the event. We were able to make some last minutes moves and adjustment, 
but for the most part were constrained by our early speculation as to how many and how 
large our meeting rooms were. It remains to be seen how good these guesses were.

Banquet: We looked at several historic buildings and museums.  We really liked the Fogg 
Art Museum at Harvard, but it was very expensive to rent.  We decided good and 
plentiful food was more important than art, so we went instead with the Old South 
Meeting House. The OSMH figures prominently in Boston's history, is walking distance 
from the hotel and is a beautiful space. We spent the bulk of our banquet budget on food, 
from a small local caterer.

Computers: We rented 10 PCs from a national chain, Rent-A-PC. They were used for the 
2002 Philadelphia ACL meeting and came highly recommended.

Audio-Visual: We are using the hotel's in-house A/V company. We eventually negotiated 
a significant discount with them (to match our other best bids), and felt the on-site 
support would be valuable, despite some communications problems. It turns out that our 
main contact person was in and out of the hospital while we were trying to finalize our 
contract.

Finances: The handling of finances was a particularly confusing issue.  It was only very 
late in the process that we learned that the local arrangements folks typically handle the 
bulk of the finances. It would have been useful to clearly specify at the beginning how 
the money would flow for particular income and expenses.

Printing; We used MITRE's in-house publications and graphics people to do the graphics 
for the bag, banner and thermos, and for copies of tutorial proceedings, etc.

2. Overview remarks
The co-chairs represent the three main fields covered by HLT/NAACL 2004 --- Susan 
Dumais (IR), Daniel Marcu (NLP) and Salim Roukos (Speech).   We divided a few tasks 
like suggestions for reviewers and assignment to area chairs by discipline, but most tasks 
cut across the disciplines.   We divided the work roughly as follows, although everyone 
responded to email and issues as they came up:  Susan, early activities like recruiting, 
paper templates, web info and final report; Daniel, review software, site management and 
PC meeting hosting; Salim, publications and final schedule.    This minimal coordination 
worked well in general.

3. Paper reviewing process
We think the paper reviewing process went very well.  Despite the early deadline, the 
quality of full-paper submissions was very high.  We think this is largely due to the 
quality of makeup of the program committee, and the growing recognition of 
HLT/NAACL as an outlet for good work at the intersection of NLP, IR and Speech.

Reviewing was done using a two-tiered system, Area Chairs and Reviewers.   Twenty 
Area Chairs were responsible for a topical area and coordinated the reviewing process 
(recruiting reviewers, assigning papers to reviewers, managing reviews and attending the 
PC meeting) in those areas.    The Area Chairs are listed at the end of this section.  The 
same review committee handled both Long papers (8 pages) and Late-breaking papers 
and posters (4 pages).   The Co-Chairs made an initial assignment of submissions to Area 
Chairs.   

There was a face-to-face PC meeting for Long papers.   Because of the different 
backgrounds of participants, we spent the first hour in a calibration process, looking at 
top-middle-and bottom papers from each discipline.   This worked well, and made many 
of the subsequent discussions easier.   Final decisions for Late-breaking papers were 
made by conference call.   Some Late-breaking papers were selected to be presented 
orally and others as posters.   Reviewing for both Full and Late-breaking papers was 
blind.  In cases where PC or Area Chairs were authors of a paper or papers were from 
their institution or former students or collaborators, others handled the reviewing process; 
persons with any conflict of interest left the room during discussions of a paper and these 
persons had no influence on the paper's final disposition, both for Long and Short 
submissions.

Because of the conference time of early May, submissions were due in the fall, which is a 
busy time for other conferences as well.  Long paper reviewing was carried out over the 
Dec/Jan holidays, but it worked out pretty well.   Late-breaking papers were due after the 
decisions for Long papers were announced, thus allowing people to resubmit if desired 
(and, in fact, some were encouraged to do so by the initial reviewers).   The turn-around 
time for Late-breaking papers was tight.  There was only one month between the 
submission deadline and notification, and only ten days between notification and final 
camera-ready papers were due, but things worked smoothly.   

Daniel handled the selection and ongoing maintenance of the reviewing software, which 
was quite a task.  He selected the START conference reviewing software.   In general the 
software worked well, although there was some inflexibility which we had to work 
around.  The main issue had to do with sharing of files by Area Chairs.  Because there 
was some overlap of areas, sub-groups wanted to share responsibilities, but this was 
difficult to do explicitly.  Overall, the reviewing software was adequate and the customer 
support outstanding. Some additional functionality would be desired, but that is true for 
any software tool.  Most of the problems in using the software package occurred because 
the PC chairs and area chairs did not put sufficient time into reading the associated 
documentation in advance.  We recommend using this software package for future 
HLT/NAACL conferences.

Based on the distribution of submissions from last year, we selected twenty area chairs.   
Some area chairs covered the same nominal area, which we did to balance the anticipated 
load.    We could have chosen to further sub-divide some areas like Information retrieval, 
but this seemed risky given the difficulties in predicting the nature of submissions.   Most 
of the Area Chairs have pretty broad backgrounds which provided us added flexibility in 
managing submissions.   In general the load balancing worked pretty well, and we tried to 
assign roughly 10 Long Papers and 5 Short Papers to each Area Chair.   We could have 
used another Area Chair in Discourse/Dialog and Syntax/Semantics, and one fewer in 
Learning and Information Retrieval.    There were more Speech papers submitted as 
Short Papers than Long Papers.

Based on the high quality of submissions, we decided to present a Best Paper Award.   
The paper we selected received all 5's from reviewers and the area chair.   The entire PC 
reviewed the paper, and thought that it represented a strong mix of theory and practice 
and was deserving of the award.    The Best Paper Award for HLT/NAACL 2004 is 
awarded to: Catching the drift: Probabilistic content models, with applications to 
generation and summarization, Regina Barzilay (MIT) and Lillian Lee (Cornell 
University).

We invited two Keynote Speakers, both of whom apply HLT tools and techniques to 
large-scale, commercial applications.  The first keynote address by Dr. Andrei Broder, 
entitled "Ten years of Web Search Technology", will give an overview the evolution of 
web search over the past decade, how users' expectations are evolving based on their use 
of web search technology, and implications of this work in the enterprise search arena. 
The second keynote address by Dr. Jill Burstein, entitled "Automated Essay Evaluation: 
From NLP research through deployment as a business", will describe the development of 
technology for automatic essay evaluation and its deployment as a business. 

The Area Chairs, Affiliations (Area) were:
Srinivas Bangalore, AT&T Labs  (Syntax/Semantics) 
Charlie Clarke, University of Waterloo  (Information retrieval)

4. Summary of paper quality and acceptances
The number of submissions increased only slightly over last year, and the quality of 
submissions was excellent.  We received 168 submissions for full papers, of which 43 
were accepted, resulting in a highly competitive acceptance rate of 26%.   (Thirty-nine 
submissions received an average score of 4.0 or higher, on a reviewing scale of 1 to 5.)  
In addition, we received 84 submissions for the late-breaking papers track, of which 40 
were accepted.  Half of the short papers are presented as short talks and others as posters.  

5. Publications
The distribution of work for putting together the proceedings and the online schedule 
could be improved.    Working with two proceedings chairs (one for Full papers and one 
for Late-breaking papers) and a web master complicates the logistics.    More 
importantly, exactly who needed what information and when it was needed was not clear.   
We started getting requests for the final lists and schedule before the Late-breaking 
papers had been decided on.    It would also have been ideal to have a single agreed upon 
format for the information so that everyone was working from the same data source.    
With many slightly different versions/formats, there are several errors that get introduced.    
And, it would have been good to allow authors to review the information that was going 
to appear in the proceedings and CDs ahead of time.

6. Areas for Improvement
We did our best to merge the different goals of the communities, and we think we 
succeeded for the most part. We also worked hard to solicit involvement from all of the 
associated communities, and we are especially pleased about the interdisciplinary nature 
of many of the papers. As the conference becomes better known, we hope to see this 
trend continue.  We feel that, although there is room for improvement, the HLT/NAACL 
merge was a success in attracting high quality work and in bridging gaps, and hope to see 
it continue next year. 
 
Most of our decisions had to be approved by a large and diverse committee representing 
NAACL, HLT, ISCA, and SIGIR, as well as different government sponsors of HLT 
research.  The situation was cumbersome at times, but usually issues were resolved 
within a few days.    Minimizing the number of issues that the committee needs to 
approve would streamline the process.

We were invited to help in organizing HLT/NAACL 2004 in early June 2003.  This is 
somewhat later than desirable since the call for participation, and recruiting of reviewers 
needed to take place very quickly.   It would have been better to do this before the 
HLT/NAACL 2003 meeting, so initial observations and coordination could have started 
at the preceding conference.

<a name="hltnaaclrep-student"></a><b>Student Workshop Chairs Report</b>

Student organizers:
Nicola Stokes, University College, Dublin
Karen Livescu, MIT
Ani Nenkova, Columbia University

Faculty co-advisors:
Amanda Stent, Stony Brook University
Eric Fosler-Lussier, Ohio State University
Lisa Ballesteros, Mount Holyoke College

Responsibilities of the student organizers:
  Advertise the workshop
  Contact reviewers and panelists
  Manage reviewing and make acceptance/rejection decisions
  Contact with authors

Responsibilities of the faculty advisors:
  NSF funding for authors to attend the workshop
  Advising the organizers

Number of papers submitted:  12 (9 NLP, 3 IR/speech/other
[bioinformatics])
Number of papers accepted:  10 (7 NLP, 3 IR/speech/other)
1 paper was received too late for consideration.

We received NSF funding:  One author per paper is funded to attend the
workshop.

Comments from the organizers:
1) The workshop is a lot of work.  Multiple student organizers are definitely needed.
  
2) This is the second HLT/NAACL student workshop, and for the second time the  
    number of submissions was low.  In addition to advertising through ACL mailing lists,  
    the organizers contacted universities directly by email, but this did not seem to help.  
    Consequently, the acceptance rate was high.  One organizer commented:

"I can see two reasons for such a small number of submissions--1) HLT has the short 
paper session, as well and a demo session, so many people prefer to submit there rather 
than at a separate student workshop. 2) the usual set-up of student/advisor relationship in 
the USA makes it very difficult for the student to have a publication without their 
advisor, thus the student session is not an option (and this is also why the short 
paper/poster session will be preferred)."

We think that perhaps if funding was guaranteed, and could therefore be widely 
publicized with the CFP, there might be more submissions.  However, this would not be 
easy to achieve.  The low number of submissions is a big problem for the student 
workshop.

3) There are too many faculty advisors, and their roles are not clear.
4) It would be nice to get reviewer suggestions from the program chairs for the main 
conference.

Comments from the faculty advisors:
1) NSF funding is important for the student workshop.  However, there is some tension 
here:  NSF is primarily interested in funding domestic students, but HLT might like to 
attract international students to the student workshop (and it is expensive to bring these 
students here).

2) One author was unable to get a visa.  The short time period between paper acceptance 
and the conference is not a help here.

3) The roles of the faculty advisors were not always clear, so sometimes responses to the 
organizers were delayed because all advisors were waiting for someone else to offer 
advice first, not wanting to step on anyone's toes.  (Note from Amanda:  I should have 
delineated clear lines of responsibility.)  However, there is too much work for one faculty 
advisor, when the need to get funding is taken into account.

4) The student organizers did a wonderful job.  They collected papers, communicated 
with the authors, coordinated the reviewing, collected the results and made the final 
decisions about acceptance/rejection.  They also spent a long time communicating with 
potential panelists.  Special thanks to Ani for contacting panelists, to Karen for collecting 
and collating reviews, and to Nicola for setting up the schedule.

Advice for future organizers/advisors:
1) Start on the proposal early, as many questions will have to be sorted out (money 
required for the room, for proceedings etc.).

2) Start collecting reviewers and panelists early.

3) In order to increase the number of submissions, it is important to advertise widely and 
often.  Also, consider ways to increase the prestige of the student session so that more 
people will submit.

4) Make a firm policy regarding international students, especially whether there will be 
more funding for an international paper than for a domestic one (and where it will come 
from).

5) Picking a day when a good audience can be expected is a guessing game.  We chose 
the [tutorial] day, the day before the conference.  However, other student 
workshops/sessions are during the main conference.

<a name="hltnaaclrep-pub"></a><b>Publications Chairs Report</b>

Miles Osborne,  Edinburgh University
Katrin Kirchoff, University of Washington
Gina Levow, University of Chicago

In summary, things went smoothly.  We divided the task into three: Gina dealt with 
workshop related matters, Katrin with the second volume and I dealt with the main 
volume, CDROM and overall co-ordination. This division of labour worked well.

Our job was considerably eased by Drago's help and availability of scripts to (semi) 
automate the task.  Additionally, creating a mailing list helped communicating with 20+ 
people.

All told, I probably spent a week of my time on publications.  Most of this time was spent 
on creating hardcopy details for the main volume and answering many email queries. I 
also re-organised the publications software a little, bugfixed  and  wrote detailed 
HOWTO instructions.

One problem encountered was timing.  I should have given all workshop organisers an 
earlier deadline and so would have allowed more time for me to assemble the CDROM 
properly.  The CDROM contains all information, so it can only be created when everyone 
is done.  This year, although I had most material a few days before the courier was due to 
pick everything up, I was still receiving material 15 minutes before I was due to burn it!  
Also, at least one workshop only started the publication process on the very last day.  
This caused Gina a lot of needless work.

Omnipress are good publishers and proved helpful: they should be used for next year.  
(JH: One major problem occurred the week before the conference:  Omnipress contacted 
us frantic because they had misnumbered the pages in the companion volume.  
Everything had already been printed when they discovered that the table of contents, 
which we had provided, was not followed in the numbering of paper pages.  They asked 
for the TOC and renumbered it to correspond to the numbering of the papers and 
reprinted those TOC pages, so hopefully this will all be fine.  They did respond to this 
problem (which was entirely their fault) swiftly.)

<a name="hltnaaclrep-tut"></a><b>Tutorial Chairs Report</b>

Alex Acero, Microsoft Research
Jamie Callan, CMU
Andy Kehler, UCSD

We went into this year's tutorial planning with a target of six tutorials, to be spread as 
evenly as possible over the three areas of Speech Processing, Information Retrieval, and 
Text Processing, and with a hope of attracting some that tied two or more of these 
together.  We received nine submissions as a result of the call and
direct solicitations.

  6. Semantic Inference for Question Answering
     Sanda Harabagiu and Srini Narayanan


Three proposals were rejected due to topic overlap considerations or concerns about the 
size of the potential audience.  Proposals 3, 4, and 8 were the result of direct solicitation, 
the remainder responded to the call.  This left our target number of 6, which achieved a 
good spread over the three areas of interest, with several achieving coverage of more than 
one area.  In one or two cases, we encouraged presenters to include additional material so 
that more than one of the three areas would be represented.  Proposal 4 originally had a 
different title and three presenters; we suggested a change in title and a reduction in 
presenters to one or two.  In their post-mortems, the HLT and NAACL Executive 
Committees might want to evaluate our approach to selecting tutorials, and give explicit 
guidance to next year's Tutorial Chairs on how to balance expected draw with other 
desiderata.

The main difficulty we had this year was getting the requested materials from presenters 
in accordance with the deadlines specified in the call and in their acceptance letters.  
Blurbs in ASCII and HTML were due on Feb 15, but additional reminders had to be sent 
after that date.  (There was also a significant delay between the time this material was 
submitted to the webmaster and when it appeared on the conference website.)  The 
deadline for submitting tutorial slides for reproduction was originally March 17, which 
none of the presenters met.  This deadline was extended to March 31, with several 
presenters still missing it.  Finally after an ultimatum was issued for an April 15 deadline, 
we received the last of them on that date.  In retrospect, the original deadline of March 17 
was probably too early to have expected presenters to be done with their slides, so in the
future we'd recommend a date that is closer to the conference, coupled with timely 
reminders sent to the presenters.

1. Submissions

We received 11 workshop proposal submissions, of which we accepted 10. The one reject 
was rejected because it was felt that the proposal was too sketchy.

2. Accepted Workshops and Projected Attendance

After the paper submission deadline, the following two workshops were merged due to 
lower than expected submissions:

<a name="hltnaaclrep-demo"></a><b>Demo Chairs Report</b>

Joseph Polifroni, Unveil Technologies
David Palmer, Virage
Deb Roy, MIT Media Lab

We received a total of 22 submissions for the demo session.  We accepted 19 demos, with 
one withdrawal.  

As of the deadline for submission, we had 20 demo proposals. After sending out targeted 
inquiries to approximately 10 sites, we received two more proposals.  

Overall, we think we have a good balance among IR/Summarization type demos, 
speech/dialogue demos, translation demos and what I'm calling NL demos (i.e., NL-
flavored demos that weren't as systems-oriented as the other demos).

The one area in which we are weak is speech synthesis, although several of the 
speech/dialogue demos have synthesis systems embedded within them.
  
We targeted several synthesis sites and sent email inquiries, but the people involved 
either didn't respond or couldn't travel to Boston at the time of the conference.

After sending out acceptances, we solicited papers for each system and received 12 
papers in response (indicated with (P) below next to the demo system).  These papers, 
which describe the demo systems will appear in the final proceedings.

For the demo plenary session, which has a 45-minute time slot and is being shared with 
an awards presentation, we selected 2 demos, "ITSPOKE: An Intelligent Tutoring 
Spoken Dialogue System," from the University of Pittsburgh, and "A Thai Speech 
Translation System for Medical Dialogs," from Carnegie Mellon University.  In addition 
to these two demos, the demo co-chairs will present an overview of the demos to be 
presented in the session, based on input from each presenter.
  
Below is the total list demo [acceptances], divided by area.

<li>Display of their logos on signage at all conference events 
<li>Space to insert a short description of their companies and their products 
into the Exhibits/Sponsors brochure, which will be given to all the conference 
participants. 
</ul>

<a name="hltnaaclrep-publicity"></a><b>Publicity Chairs Report</b>

Shri Narayanan USC
Peter Anick, Overture
Peter Heeman, OHSU

The publicity chairs have two major roles: 
<ul>
<li>International: Disseminating information about the conference (calls for papers, 
etc.) to the largest possible appropriate technical audience 
<li>Local: Accessing and bringing in the press at the time of the conference 
</ul>
The Publicity chairs focused on pre-conference publicity through email lists, hard-copy 
posters, and endorsements.
 
Email lists:  email was sent for the Conference Announcement,  Call for Tutorial 
Proposals, Call for Papers, Student Call for Papers, Workshop Call for Papers.  They 
were sent  to the ISCA newsletter (editor Chris Wellekens), ACL mailing list (via 
Priscilla Rasmussen), the IEEE Speech Technical Committee Newsletter  (editor Richard 
Rose), SIGIR-ANNOUNCE mailing list and the IR-LIST.

Posters: We produced hard-copy posters for the conference, modeled after the ASRU 
2003 poster.   Members of the Organizing Committee were asked to distribute copies of 
the posters.  The posters were mailed out in mid-November, and mailed to academic, 
industry laboratories both in the USA and abroad.

Endorsement: were received from SIGIR and ISCA.
