The next lab meeting will be Wednesday June 13 2012, at 11:00am in TASC1 9408. Max Whitney will do another practice talk for his ACL presentation:

Whitney, M., & Sarkar, A. (2012). Bootstrapping via Graph Propagation. In Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2012). Jeju Island, R. of Korea: Association for Computational Linguistics. 

abstract: 
Bootstrapping a classifier from a small set of seed rules can be viewed as the propagation of labels between examples via features shared between them. This paper introduces a novel variant of the Yarowsky algorithm based on this view. It is a bootstrapping learning method which uses a graph propagation algorithm with a well defined objective function. The experimental results show that our proposed bootstrapping algorithm achieves state of the art performance or better on several different natural language data sets.

We will also begin to discuss this year's NAACL and WMT.
