The next lab meeting will be on Wednesday February 1, 2012 at 3:30pm, in TASC1 9408.






We will discuss ACL long paper submissions, and then Milan Tofiloski will present:


> I will provide a broad overview of discourse and discourse parsing, focusing on relations and markers. Markers can be either explicit or implicit. I will discuss the problems associated with the two marker types. I'll also go over the application of discourse parsing toward sentiment analysis.






Later note: both items were postponed until next week and the meeting was instead a review of current work.
