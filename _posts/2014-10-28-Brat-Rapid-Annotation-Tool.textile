Brat is a web-based tool for text annotation; which is going to be presented by Jasneet in the lab meeting this week (29th of Oct).
<a href="http://brat.nlplab.org/">Brat</a> is designed in particular for structured annotation, where the notes are not freeform text but have a fixed form that can be automatically processed and interpreted by a computer.
The meeting will be at TASC1 9408 from 1030 hours.
