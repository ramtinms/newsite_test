Dr. Anoop  Sarkar, from the Natural Language Lab at Simon Fraser University recently won the IBM Faculty Award for his research  in computational linguistics and natural language processing.

The IBM faculty award is a competitive worldwide program given to faculty members having an outstanding reputation  for contributions in a research area that is potentially useful to IBM Research and Development. The candidate for  the award is nominated by an IBM employee, and the candidate submits a proposal for a research program whose merits  are then evaluated by IBM.

Dr. Sarkar's research deals with implicitly training a computer to understand, extract information from or translate  natural languages that are spoken and written by humans such as English, Spanish, etc.He says, "Humans don't get  explicitly trained in language, but get implicitly trained". For example, one aspect of natural language processing  is to implicitly train a computer to translate between languages using examples of previously translated sentences.  The idea is to feed a computer algorithm, lots of examples of translations from a source language (say, Chinese) to  a target language (say, English), and expect the computer to learn from these examples.

Specifically, Dr. Sarkar's research focuses on how much training needs to be given to the computer. For example,  let's assume that fifty million sentences of Chinese to English translated texts are currently being used to train a  translation system. But, what happens when there is a language pair (of source and target languages) for which there  isn't enough text to train the system?   His research attempts to find out whether it's required to feed the computer all the examples needed to do the  translations, or whether you can get away with giving only a few examples, and have the computer infer from this  limited amount of supervision.
