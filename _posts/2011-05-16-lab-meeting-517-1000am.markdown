Practice talk: Automatic Generation of Multilingual Sports Summaries (Fahim Hasan)


> Natural Language Generation is a subfield of Natural Language Processing,
> which is concerned with automatically creating human readable text from
> non-linguistic forms of information. A template-based approach to Natural
> Language Generation utilizes base formats for different types of sentences,
> which are subsequently transformed to create the final readable forms of the
> output. In this thesis, we investigate the suitability of a template-based
> approach to multilingual Natural Language Generation of sports summaries. We
> implement a system to generate English and Bangla summaries making use of a
> pipelined architecture to transform data in multiple stages. Additionally,
> we investigate the evaluation of automatically generated summaries, and look
> at how they differ from human generated summaries. We show that by using a
> template-based approach the system can generate acceptable output in
> multiple languages without requiring detailed grammatical knowledge, which
> is important for languages such as Bangla where computational resources are
> still scarce.
