> Large amounts of bilingual data and monolingual data in the target language are usually used to train statistical machine translation systems. In this paper we propose several semi-supervised techniques within a Bengali English Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) System in order to improve translation quality. We conduct experiments on a Bengali-English dataset and our initial experimental results show improvement in translation quality.
