Abstract:






> Statistical machine translation (SMT) models require bilingual corpora for training, and these corpora are often multilingual with parallel text in multiple languages simultaneously. We introduce an active learning task of adding a new language to an existing multilingual set of parallel text and constructing high quality MT systems, from each language in the collection into this new target language. We show that adding a new language using active learning to the EuroParl corpus provides a signiÔ¨Åcant improvement compared to a random sentence selection baseline. We also provide new highly effective sentence selection methods that improve AL for phrase-based SMT in the multilingual and single language pair setting.
