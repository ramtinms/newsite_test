title: Context-Specific Sentiment Lexicon Expansion via Minimal User Interaction
---

In the lab meeting on Wednesday, Raheleh Makki from Dalhousie University will give a talk. A short description about the talk is below 

**Abstract** 


One of the important factors in the performance of sentiment analysis methods is having a comprehensive
sentiment lexicon. However, since sentiment words have different polarities not only in
different domains, but also in different contexts within the same domain, constructing such context-specific
sentiment lexicons is not an easy task. The high costs of manually constructing such lexicons
motivate researchers to create automatic methods for finding sentiment words and assigning their
polarities. However, existing methods may encounter ambiguous cases with contradictory evidences
which are hard to automatically resolve. To address this problem, we aim to engage the user in the
process of polarity assignment and improve the quality of the generated lexicon via minimal user
effort. A novel visualization is employed to present the results of the automatic algorithm, i.e., the
extracted sentiment pairs along with their polarities. User interactions are provided to facilitate the
supervision process. The results of our user study demonstrate (1) involving the user in the polarity
assignment process improves the quality of the generated lexicon significantly, and (2) participants in
the study preferred our visual interface and conveyed that it is easier to use compared to a text-based
interface.

The lab meeting will be from 1130 hours at TASC1 9408.
