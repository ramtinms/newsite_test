# **Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation**


**February 25, 2009**

**Location:** TASC1 9408

**Presenter:** Baskaran Sankaran

**Time:** 12:30pm  -1:30 pm

> I will be presenting the Hierarchical Machine Translation system (Chiang, 07 and Chiang 05). The original motivation is to have a fusion of both syntax-based and phrase-based systems. The translation model is synchronous context-free grammar, learnt automatically from bitext without syntactic annotations of a treebank. Instead of the normal phrases of the phrase-based systems, here the phrases are hierarchical, (i.e) sub-phrases within large phrases.  Apart from covering the system in detail, I will be focussing on two aspects: i) phrase-extraction and ii) language model integration.
