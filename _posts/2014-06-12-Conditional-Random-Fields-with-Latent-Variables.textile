In the lab meeting on Wednesday, 18th June, Mark will give a talk about "Conditional Random Fields with Latent Variables". He will start by reviewing conditional random fields (CRFs) and how to handle general graph structures and latent variables in these models, and then he will discuss all of the following extensions in a common framework: higher-order CRFs, dynamic CRFs, hidden CRFs, semi-Markov CRFs, latent dynamic CRFs, hidden-unit CRFs, conditional neural fields (CNFs), hidden-dynamics CRFs, latent dynamic CNFs, and infinite CRFs. The meeting will end with a discussion about some speculation on what the next steps are in this area. The meeting will be at TASC1 9408 from 1100 hours.
