Anoop Sarkar will talk about ideas on dependency parsing.


> **Arc-standard and Arc-eager shift-reduce dependency parsing**
> I will talk about shift-reduce parsing for dependency parsers. In particular I will describe the algorithms introduced by Nivre et al. and used in their dependency parser: MALTparser (yes, it's single malt). I will talk about the connection between dependency parsers and parsers for context-free grammars, which might provide a uniform framework for the different Nivre-style algorithms.
