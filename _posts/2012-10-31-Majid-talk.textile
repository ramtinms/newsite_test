Majid Razmara will give a talk in the lab meeting tomorrow , 31st October . 

"Triangulation is translating from a source language to a target language via an intermediate language. In this project, we use multiple intermediate languages, dynamically triangulate rules and combine them using the ensemble decoding approach."
