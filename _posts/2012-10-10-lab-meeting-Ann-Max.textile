Ann Clifton and Max Whitney will discuss about Language modeling on Wednesday, October 10th. "We propose a discriminative language model that uses latent syntactic features. Using a passive-aggressive online learning algorithm, the model jointly learns shallow and full syntactic structures to distinguish between human generated sentences and artificial sentences sampled from an n-gram language model."
