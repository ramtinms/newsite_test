h3. Abstract

Integrating, representing, and reasoning over human knowledge is a computational grand challenge for the 21st century. Currently, most IR approaches are keyword-based statistical approaches. When the input is sparse, noisy, and ambiguous, knowledge is needed to fill the gap. In this lecture, I will focus on knowledge powered information retrieval. I will introduce the Probase project at Microsoft Research Asia, whose goal is to enable machines to understand human communications. Probase is a universal, probabilistic taxonomy more comprehensive than any current taxonomy. It contains more than 2 million concepts, harnessed automatically from a corpus of 1.68 billion web pages and two yearsâ€™ worth of search-log data. It enables probabilistic interpretations of search queries, document titles, ad keywords, etc. The probabilistic nature also enables it to incorporate heterogeneous information naturally. I will explain how the core taxonomy, which contains hypernym-hyponym relationships, is constructed and how it models knowledge's inherent uncertainty, ambiguity, and inconsistency.
