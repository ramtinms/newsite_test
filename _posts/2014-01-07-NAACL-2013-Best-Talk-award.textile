At the NAACL 2013 conference in Atlanta we recorded all of the main session oral presentations and the tutorials.  You can watch the videos online at <a href="http://techtalks.tv/naacl/2013/">techtalks.tv/naacl/</a> or by following the links in the <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N13/">NAACL 2013 page in the ACL anthology</a>.

The NAACL Board decided to use the videos to create a Best Talk award.  We nominated the 4 talks got the most votes in the <a href="2013/post-conference-survey.pdf">NAACL 2013 post-conference survey</a>.  The survey was sent out to conference attendees immediately after the conference, and it included the question "What was your favorite <b>talk</b> at the conference?".  173 people responded to the survey (25% of all conference goers).  

The nominees were:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://techtalks.tv/talks/improved-reordering-for-pbsmt-using-sparse-features/58430/">Colin Cherry "Improved Reordering for Phrase-Based Translation using Sparse Features"</a></li>
<li><a href="http://techtalks.tv/talks/ppdb-the-paraphrase-database/58473/">Juri Ganitkevitch "PPDB: The Paraphrase Database"</a></li>

</ul>

We selected the winner by distributing the video recordings of the 4 nominated talks to the NAACL membership.  160 people watched the videos and voted.  The winner of the NAACL 2013 Best Talk award is <b><a href="http://www.riedelcastro.org">Sebastian Riedel</a></b> for his talk on <a href="http://techtalks.tv/talks/relation-extraction-with-matrix-factorization-and-universal-schemas/58435/">"Relation Extraction with Matrix Factorization and Universal Schemas"</a>.

The goal of this award is to recognize NAACL presenters to put together excellent talks and to promote good scientific communication within our community.  Sebastianâ€™s talk describes an extremely exciting research agenda, and he managed to convey his research in a way that engages the audience and sparks our intellectual curiosity.  

Congratulations to Sebastian and to all of the Best Talk Award nominees!
