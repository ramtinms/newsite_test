The natlang lab meeting on Thu 7/16/2009 will be in TASC1 9408 at 11:30am. 

Manaal Faruqui will be presenting the work he has done during his summer-long MITACS Globalink internship in our lab. Manaal is an undergraduate student in [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ernet.in/) and spent the summer with our lab working on machine translation, collaborating with Baskaran Sankaran and Anoop Sarkar on model adaptation for hierarchical phrase-based machine translation. 

Title: [Model Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation for Synchronous Context‐Free Grammars](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop/students/manaal/manaal-slides_july-2009.pdf)

Abstract:

> Hierarchical phrase based translation uses context free grammar rules for decoding source sentences into target language sentences. We derive rules for translation from a parallel corpus which are then exploited to translate sentences. Thus in effect we have a large table containing source and target language phrase pairs composed of  terminals and non-terminals.
> 
> In this talk we go deeper and explore the case where we have a limited amount of in-domain parallel text for deriving  the rules of the given language pair. We assume the availability of a very large amount of out-of-domain parallel text for the same language pair. So we have a large parallel corpus for out-of-domain data and a small parallel corpus for the in-domain data. We carry out experiments to improve the translation score by training our system on the rules from the two domains.
