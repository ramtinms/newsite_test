See "here":http://www.sfu.ca/content/sfu/sub/about/maps-and-directions/burnaby.html for maps and driving and transit instructions. If you come by bus, stay on until the last stop on campus (the Bus Loop next to Lot E in the map). It is a short walk south to TASC-1. If you drive up, you will have to find parking in one of the visitor spots and make your way to the TASC-1 building. The closest visitor parking is Lot VB in the map above.

Fred Popowich's office number is 9423, on the 2nd floor of the building. Anoop Sarkar's office number is 9427, on the 2nd floor of the building.
