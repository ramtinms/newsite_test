An implementation of the Yarowsky algorithm and other bootstrapping algorithms. This software accompanies the paper "Bootstrapping via Graph Propagation":{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/whitneysarkar2012 by Max Whitney and Anoop Sarkar, which appears in the Proceedings of ACL 2012. There are also "slides":http://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~mwhitney/personal/yarowsky-propagation-slides.pdf from the ACL presentation.
