           <h2>Minutes from <span class="caps">NAACL</span> Board Meeting</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Date: June 25, 2013</li>
	<li>Location: <span class="caps">ACL</span>/<span class="caps">NAACL</span>-<span class="caps">HLT</span> 2014 in Baltimore, MD, <span class="caps">USA</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Emily Bender (Board Member) <del>-</del> via Skype</li>
	<li>Chris Callison-Burch (Past Chair)</li>
	<li>Hal Daum√© <span class="caps">III</span> (Chair)</li>
	<li>Katrin Erk (Board Member)</li>
	<li>Graeme Hirst (<span class="caps">ACL</span> Representative)</li>
	<li>Julia Hirschberg (Board Member)</li>
	<li>Ed Hovy (Board Member)</li>
	<li>Joel Tetreault (Treasurer)</li>
	<li>Michael White (Secretary)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reinstating two-year terms for pubs chairs: Hal for Rada</h3>
<ul>
	<li>For better continuity, publication chairs should be co-chairs for 2 years with overlapping terms.</li>
	<li><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> Hal will coordinate with <span class="caps">ACL</span> on whether continuing pubs co-chair will serve when <span class="caps">ACL</span> is joint with <span class="caps">NAACL</span>-<span class="caps">HLT</span> or continue the following year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treasurer&#8217;s Report: Joel</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Joel led discussion of <a href="NAACL_Treasurer_Report_2014.pdf">his report</a></li>
	<li>The board agreed to the treasurer&#8217;s recommendation to continue funding the <span class="caps">LSA</span> Summer Institute and <span class="caps">NACLO</span> at $5k each and the Emerging Regions fund at up to $3k.</li>
	<li>Graeme reported that it was not yet clear whether the <span class="caps">ACL</span>/<span class="caps">NAACL</span>-<span class="caps">HLT</span> conference would make a profit (despite record attendance) as many costs scale linearly with additional attendees and larger venues are generally more expensive.</li>
	<li>Chris reported that the <span class="caps">JHU</span> summer workshops are unlikely to continue (for personnel reasons) and thus <span class="caps">NAACL</span> need not plan on supporting them going forward.</li>
	<li><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> Emily and Katrin volunteered to be in charge of Emerging Regions initiatives.</li>
	<li>Joel led discussion of his proposal to seek more sponsorship especially from start-ups, including the need to coordinate with Priscilla and the <span class="caps">ACL</span> sponsorship chairs.</li>
	<li><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> Hal will talk to Rada and get attendee list from this year&#8217;s conference, then set up a shared list of potential sponsors&#8217; contact and fiscal year info.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of <span class="caps">ACL</span> 2014 reports: Hal</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Conference chairs&#8217; reports:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://69.195.124.161/~aclwebor/adminwiki/index.php?title=2014Q3_Reports:_General_Chair"><span class="caps">ACL</span> General Chair</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://69.195.124.161/~aclwebor/adminwiki/index.php?title=2014Q3_Reports:_Program_Chairs"><span class="caps">ACL</span> Program Chairs</a></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Hal led discussion of tracking reviewer quality info on <span class="caps">START</span>; no special role for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> envisioned at present.</li>
	<li>Anoop plans to discuss incorporating Mark Dredze&#8217;s reviewer load balancing tool into <span class="caps">START</span> with Rich Gerber.</li>
	<li>The board agreed that supplementary materials submitted with conference papers should be anonymized, contra the <span class="caps">ACL</span> decision, but that it would be better for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> and <span class="caps">ACL</span> to be in agreement on this policy.</li>
	<li><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> Hal will go back to the <span class="caps">ACL</span> board to discuss revisiting this policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best paper policies: Hal for Lucy Vanderwende</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The board agreed that in the interest of fairness, there should always be awards given for best long paper, best short paper and best student paper, and that up to six runners-up for best paper awards should also be publicized.  This decision is consistent with the new <span class="caps">ACL</span> policy, though more specific on the maximum number of runners-up.</li>
	<li>It was noted that it would be very helpful to gather student status info at paper submission time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pre-publication policies: Hal for <span class="caps">ACL</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hal led discussion of the <span class="caps">ACL</span> policy to allow submission of papers that have already appeared online as tech reports, arxiv.org e-prints, etc., as long as they have not already appeared as a peer-reviewed publication.</li>
	<li>The board agreed to go along with the <span class="caps">ACL</span> policy, noting that grey areas will need to continue to be handled at the discretion of the conference program chairs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social media policy: Mike</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Mike led discussion of whether <span class="caps">NAACL</span> should consider adopting a social media policy, e.g. to discourage unprofessional behavior in live tweeting about the conference.</li>
	<li>The board agreed that there does not yet appear to be a compelling need for a social media policy per se, though social media should be covered by other policies.</li>
	<li>Increased use of social media was also discussed, with the board agreeing to make announcements regularly on Twitter as well as the website, and with the use of social media during conferences left up to the organizers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anti-harassment policy: Hal</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hal and Emily reviewed reactions to the new policy, including concerns about potential for abuse and the privacy of any record keeping, as well as confusion as to why the policy had been enacted.</li>
	<li>The board agreed to revise the policy to emphasize its purpose in promoting respectful scientific debate, to highlight the responsibility of the community as a whole to take part in its promotion, and to simplify the section on implementation, in particular removing provisions for record keeping.</li>
	<li>A decision was also made to revise the policy immediately and include a question about it in the post-conference survey, in order to better gauge attitudes towards the policy among the larger membership.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dietary accommodations: Julia</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Julia noted a concern about the lack of adequate accommodations for those with dietary restrictions (e.g. kosher, halal, vegan, food allergies).</li>
	<li>The board agreed that local organizers should be encouraged to include pointers to potential suppliers in the local food guide.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Elections: Mike</h3>
<ul>
	<li>From the <span class="caps">NAACL</span> constitution:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Elections shall be conducted annually as follows: the Nominating Committee shall by the first of September preceding the end of a term of office nominate at least one person for each position to be filled, including any necessary new Nominating Committee member. The Secretary shall send to the Chapter Members notice of the nominations by September 15, at the same time requesting additional nominations. Additional nominations, supported by at least three Chapter Members, may be submitted by the fifteenth of October; evidence must be presented that the nominee will serve if elected. If there is more than one nominee for any position, the Secretary shall send ballots for that position to the Members. A majority vote of the ballots received by the fifteenth of December shall determine the results of such contests. Those elected shall take office on the first of January following.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Hal noted that the nominating committee has begun its work and that he recommends the committee suggest no more than two nominees per position.</li>
</ul>

	<ul>

		<li>Julia Hirschberg (Board Member)</li>
		<li>Joel Tetreault (Treasurer)</li>

<h2>Decisions made over email</h2>
<h3>October 10, 2014</h3>
<p>The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> board unanimously voted to endorse a <a href="http://jisic.epn.edu.ec/index.php/cronograma/workshop-pnl">Workshop on Natural Language Processing</a> to be held on October 21, 2014, as part of the 5th Information Systems Research Working Days (<span class="caps">JISIC</span> 2014), hosted by the Department of Informatics and Computer Science of the National Polytechnic School of Ecuador.</p>
<h3>September 24, 2014</h3>
<p>The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> board unanimously voted to amend the <a href="../../policies/sponsorship-requests.html">Policy on Sponsorship or Endorsement Requests</a> to bring it more in line with a <a href="http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Resolutions#November_13.2C_2009">related <span class="caps">ACL</span> resolution</a>.</p>
<h3>September, 16, 2014</h3>
<p>Emily Bender and Katrin Erk reported on the Emerging Regions Fund decisions as follows.</p>
<p>We received six applications to the Emerging Regions Fund call and chose to fund two at (up to $1500) each:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://golem.iimas.unam.mx/hackatonpln"><span class="caps">NLP</span> Hackathon</a> in Mexico, $1500 to support the travel of 10 participants</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>$1500 to support student participation at <span class="caps">PROPOR</span> in Brazil</li>
</ul>
<p>In approving $3k we have maxed out this fund for this year, and won&#8217;t be issuing another call until next time around (next summer, if approved).</p>
<p>Two of the other proposals were from individual students to support their own travel to conferences at which they had papers accepted.  We determined that such individual support was not within the remit of the program.</p>
<h3>May 20, 2014</h3>
<p>The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> board unanimously voted to approve funding of $5000 for <span class="caps">NACLO</span> in 2014 as in previous years.</p>
<h3>May 4, 2014</h3>
<p>Rada Mihalcea agreed to serve as general chair for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2015 with Joyce Chai and Anoop Sarkar as program co-chairs.</p>
<h3>April 29, 2014</h3>
<p>The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> board unanimously voted to approve the <a href="../../policies/sponsorship-requests.html">Policy on Sponsorship or Endorsement Requests</a></p>
<p>The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> board unanimously voted to endorse the <a href="http://allchildrenreading.org/challenge/">All Children Reading Enabling Writers Challenge</a></p>
<h3>March 28, 2014</h3>
<p>The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> board selected the Denver Sheraton as the venue for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2015 and either San Diego Starwood hotel for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2016, in order to co-locate with <span class="caps">ICML</span> in 2016 and to enable better negotiating power by going with Starwood for both years.</p>
<h3>March 4, 2014</h3>
<p>The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> board unanimously voted to approve the addition of implementation guidelines to the <a href="../../policies/anti-harassment.html">Anti-Harassment Policy</a></p>
<h3>February 16, 2014</h3>
<p>The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> chair approved the &#8220;technical sponsorship&#8221; of the <span class="caps">IEEE</span> <span class="caps">SLT</span>-2014 Workshop (with no monetary sponsorship).</p>
