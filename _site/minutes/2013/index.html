<h3><span class="caps">NAACL</span> <span class="caps">HLT</span> 2013 Report: Lucy Vanderwende</h3>
<h4>Firsts at <span class="caps">NAACL</span> <span class="caps">HLT</span> 2013</h4>
<ul>
	<li><span class="caps">TACL</span> papers presented.
	<ul>
		<li>6 papers split up into 4 oral and 2 poster (same percent as <span class="caps">NAACL</span> papers). In the future, it may well be that all <span class="caps">TACL</span> papers will be oral. An alternative is for <span class="caps">TACL</span> reviewers to decide poster versus oral at time of acceptance.</li>
		<li>Papers accepted to <span class="caps">NAACL</span> first, then <span class="caps">TACL</span> papers added to program. This does not scale.</li>
		<li>The <span class="caps">TACL</span> website might be more explicit about the type of presentation <span class="caps">TACL</span> authors will have at <span class="caps">ACL</span> or <span class="caps">NAACL</span>. Right now there is no explicit mention that &#8220;presentation&#8221; may be poster as well as oral.</li>
		<li><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> <span class="caps">CCB</span> will contact the <span class="caps">TACL</span> editors about revising their website.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Reviewer pool was unified across areas.
	<ul>
		<li>Area chairs chose reviewers and then the union of reviewers was sent a request to review.</li>
		<li>Mark Dredze wrote the code that identified the numbers of reviewers required per area.</li>
		<li>Total number of papers assigned to reviewers was across all tracks (not the sum of papers bid for over all tracks).</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Policy issues decided by the general and program chairs
	<ul>
		<li>Must there be a best paper in each category? No best long paper was awarded this year.</li>
		<li>Definition of previous publication. Is arxiv paper previously published or not? Can be identified but not reviewed. <span class="caps">TBD</span>.</li>
		<li>Video recording. Where are the tutorial videos published, and where are the slides uploaded. <span class="caps">TBD</span>.</li>
		<li>Poster versus oral. Only oral presentations are recorded, but not posters. Upload videos for posters? <span class="caps">TBD</span>.</li>
		<li>Standardize when the general chair and program chairs are selected. <span class="caps">TBD</span>.</li>
		<li>Publication chairs should be co-chairs for 2 years with overlapping terms.</li>
		<li><span class="caps">NAACL</span> publication chairs needed more interaction with <code>*SEM</code> publication chairs.</li>
		<li>What should the target acceptance rate be?</li>
		<li>Best 10 year retrospective award.</li>
		<li>Invite papers from related areas?</li>
		<li>Having <span class="caps">ICML</span> just after <span class="caps">NAACL</span> seems to be useful and may have increased attendance.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Websites going forward (Q from Anoop)
	<ul>
		<li>Should happen in the future, but who should do the groundwork? Pub chairs or the <span class="caps">NAACL</span> board?</li>
		<li><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> discuss creating a long-term website for <span class="caps">ACL</span>/<span class="caps">NAACL</span> for <span class="caps">ACL</span> 2014 and so on.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Choosing the best paper award committee (Q from <span class="caps">CCB</span>)
	<ul>
		<li>Not chosen from the area chairs.</li>
		<li>More senior members of the community were chosen.</li>
		<li>Not blind. Based on camera ready copy (which also caused a delay in the program).</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Workshop deadline dates for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> (Q from Joel)
	<ul>
		<li>Maybe the workshop deadlines are too late? Probably affected the number of submissions to workshops.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>3rd day of <code>*SEM</code> (Q from <span class="caps">CCB</span>)
	<ul>
		<li><code>*SEM</code> is joint between <span class="caps">SIGLEX</span> and <span class="caps">SIGSEM</span>.</li>
		<li>The 3rd day was because of <span class="caps">SEMEVAL</span> (comes from <span class="caps">SIGLEX</span>). <span class="caps">SEMEVAL</span> is 2 days. <code>*SEM</code> is 2 days. Total of 3 days.</li>
		<li><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> Board should ensure that conferences colocated with <span class="caps">NAACL</span> should not have their own workshops.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Registration Stats: Priscilla
	<ul>
		<li>Priscilla: 613 conference+workshop registered. 104 registered for workshop only.</li>
		<li>Sponsorship: $26K-$28K only. <span class="caps">ACL</span> is almost $60K.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NOTE</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">ANOOP</span></strong> 2011 does not have the conference reports online.</p>
<p>Daniel Marcu is next year&#8217;s <span class="caps">ACL</span> 2014 general chair.</p>
<h3>Treasurer&#8217;s Report: Joel Tetrault</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="NAACL_Treasurer_Report_2013.pdf">Treasurer report</a> by Joel Tetrault.</li>
	<li>Discussion about registration fees and sponsorship expenses.</li>
	<li>Suggestion to have a multi-year contract with a hotel chain to save money over multiple years.
	<ul>
		<li>Not enough bids, so we go to a system where Priscilla is the local arrangements chair.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> Priscilla will look into places to do a two year contract with a hotel chain for 2015 and 2016. Likely will be East Coast and West Coast alternating.</p>
<h3>Next Elections: Anoop Sarkar</h3>
<p>From the <span class="caps">NAACL</span> constitution:</p>

A majority vote of the ballots received by the fifteenth of December shall determine the results of such contests. Those elected shall take office on the first of January following.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chair must have served on the Board for at least one year during the past five years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The previous nominating committee already got many names to run in the 2012 elections.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> <span class="caps">CCB</span> will email the nominating committee to get started. Nominations will be sent to the membership by September 15th, 2013.</p>
<h3>Acceptance Rates: Question from Ted Pedersen</h3>
<p>Two requests from Ted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Report per-area acceptance for <span class="caps">NAACL</span>.
	<ul>
		<li>This is already done during the business meeting of <span class="caps">NAACL</span>. Perhaps can be posted online as well.</li>
		<li><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> <span class="caps">CCB</span> to see if the per area acceptance rates can be posted online. Perhaps the general chair report can just include these stats and we would put that online as a matter of course.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The influence of <code>*SEM</code> on <span class="caps">NAACL</span>.
	<ul>
		<li>This was discussed in the previous point about co-located conferences and workshops.</li>
		<li>See previous <strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> on conferences co-located with <span class="caps">NAACL</span>.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Anti-Harassment Policy: Julia</h3>
<p>Discussion on the adoption of the <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Anti-harassment"><span class="caps">SIGPLAN</span> Conference Anti-Harassment Policy</a> by the <span class="caps">NAACL</span> conferences.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Graeme shared the discussion at the <span class="caps">ACL</span> exec on this matter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> Board voted to accept a suitably modified version of the <span class="caps">SIGPLAN</span> policy and change it to ask anyone who thinks they are affected by the actions covered by this policy to contact any person of the <span class="caps">NAACL</span> board or Priscilla Rasmussen.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">LSA</span> strategic planning: <span class="caps">CCB</span></h3>
<p><span class="caps">LSA</span> sent us an email with survey questions to get the perspective of computational linguists to <span class="caps">NAACL</span>.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ACTION</span> <span class="caps">ITEM</span></strong> <span class="caps">CCB</span> will email the questions to the board. <span class="caps">CCB</span> and Emily will answer the questions (including feedback from members of the board).</p>
<h3>Post conference survey: <span class="caps">CCB</span></h3>
<p>A survey collecting information from <span class="caps">NAACL</span> attendees will be sent out. The results will help us plan for future NAACLs.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KwVQuqNclWQ_qRFwfx9l9Iroq64Izcff_r5MogqNB3w/viewform?edit_requested=true">Example survey by <span class="caps">CCB</span></a></p>

<h3>Discuss GC/PC Chairs for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2015</h3>
<p>Discussion about picking general chair and program chairs for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2015.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Decisions made over email</h2>
<h3>Apr 30, 2013</h3>
<p>The <span class="caps">NAACL</span> board unanimously voted to approve funding of $5000 for <span class="caps">NACLO</span> in 2013 as in previous years.</p>
<h3>Mar 14, 2013</h3>
<p>Matt Post, the publications co-chair for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2013 proposed the creation of a digital version of the program handbook for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2013. This would be a mobile app that would allow conference goers to view and organize their schedules, see which talks are being held where, and provide the information that a hard copy program handbook usually provides. The chair (Chris Callison-Burch) called for discussion on this proposal on Mar 11, 2013.</p>
<p>There was a discussion among the board members. The issue of cost came up. There is a savings of $10K from discontinuing thumb drives for distributing the proceedings. We cannot save money on printing fewer hard copy program hanbooks as there is a contract in place with Omnipress to have handbooks printed this year for all attendees of <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2013 (at a cost of around $3,800, about $4.50 per book). So, this year, we cannot give the option to either have the mobile app or the hardcopy program handbook. But in future conferences, there is the potential to save on printing costs if most people will use the app version of the program handbook. The development of the app for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2013 was priced at $6900 from CrowdCompass.</p>
<p>The board unanimously approved the expenditure for the development of the program handbook app for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2013 (only Rebecca Hwa abstained but she was away from her email). Chris Callison-Burch negotiated a better price than the earlier quote with the price for two conferences (this year&#8217;s <span class="caps">NAACL</span> and the next year&#8217;s) for $5K each. The board hopes to recover $7K extra this year, either from registration fees or from increased sponsorships to cover the additional cost.</p>
<h3>Feb 4, 2013</h3>
<p>Chris Callison-Burch called for a discussion and subsequent vote on discontinuing thumb drives at <span class="caps">NAACL</span> conferences.</p>
<p>Matt Post, one of this year&#8217;s publications co-chairs has been in contact with our publisher (Omnipress) about producing the thumb drives.  He provided them with an initial estimate of 850 <span class="caps">USB</span> thumb drives, based on previous years&#8217; attendance.  The estimate for producing and shipping the drives is $8,580 ($10.09 per drive).</p>
<p>Matt suggested that we should consider discontinuing the thumb drive or making it an optional extra that could be added at the time of registration, and that the savings could be re-directed to other distribution means (e.g. better WiFi on-site, or an App for interacting with the proceedings and conference schedule).</p>
<p>This matter discussed with the <span class="caps">NAACL</span>-<span class="caps">HLT</span> 2013 Program Chairs and General Chair. It was pointed out that when Hal Daume was the publication chair for <span class="caps">ICML</span>, they disbanded the memory sticks.  There were few complaints and the saved a lot of money.</p>
<p>The vote was taken by email and the following members voted <span class="caps">YES</span>.</p>
<p>Votes in favor:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Emily Bender</li>
	<li>Chris Callison-Burch</li>
	<li>Mona Diab</li>
	<li>Katrin Erk</li>
	<li>Julia Hirschberg</li>
	<li>Rebecca Hwa</li>
	<li>Anoop Sarkar</li>
	<li>Joel Tetreault</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstained:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Graeme Hirst</li>
</ul>
<p>There were no NO votes, so <span class="caps">NAACL</span> is going to implement this motion.</p>
<p>A few points arose during the discussion.</p>
<ul>
	<li>We hope to have a few thumb drives in the registration desk for people to make copies into their devices.</li>
	<li>We hope there will be a possibility to cache the proceedings on the local network obviating large fees for downloading the proceedings over the hotel wifi network.</li>
