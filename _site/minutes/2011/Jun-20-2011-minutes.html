</ul>
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Rebecca Hwa (Chair)</li>
	<li>Chris Manning (Treasurer)</li>
	<li>Anoop Sarkar (Secretary)</li>
	<li>Owen Rambow (Past Chair)</li>

<h2>Financial Discussions</h2>
<ol>
	<li><a href="NAACL_Treasurers_Report_2011.pdf">Link to Treasurer&#8217;s report</a></li>
	<li><span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2010 &#8212; strategies to prevent huge losses in the future.
	<ol>
		<li><span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2010 in LA led to a huge loss, roughly half of the contingency fund was depleted.</li>
		<li>The various reasons were discussed including the lower than expected registration and the budget negotiated with the hotel.</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>Discussion on the proposed financial redistribution with respect to <span class="caps">ACL</span> (discussion led by Graeme Hirst who is <span class="caps">ACL</span> treasurer)
	<ol>
		<li>The proposed change would lead to a less control by <span class="caps">NAACL</span> over the overall <span class="caps">NAACL</span> budget which would be controlled by <span class="caps">ACL</span>, but <span class="caps">ACL</span> would continue to shoulder the risk at a conference loss.</li>
		<li>This would amortize risk across the different <span class="caps">ACL</span> chapters (<span class="caps">NAACL</span> and <span class="caps">EACL</span>) to a central <span class="caps">ACL</span> budget</li>
		<li>After discussion, no particular decision was reached.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="caps">NAACL</span>-<span class="caps">HLT</span> 2013</h2>
<ol>
	<li><span class="caps">STATUS</span>: signed with Westin, Atlanta for June 9 &#8212; June 14. Will <span class="caps">ICML</span> take place in the following week?</li>
	<li><span class="caps">TODO</span> items:
	<ol>
		<li>Recruit local arrangements oversight committee (contact members in Gatech, Emory, etc.)</li>
		<li>Still need to fix banquet venue (e.g., coca cola museum, aquarium)</li>
		<li>Find General Conference Chair (<span class="caps">GCC</span>) &amp; PC co-chair.

<h2><span class="caps">NAACL</span>-<span class="caps">HLT</span> 2012</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Montreal Sheraton for the week of June 3 &#8212; June 8.</li>
	<li>Guy Lapalme and Sabine Bergler have both agreed to be on the advisory committee.</li>
	<li>Discussion issuess:
	<ol>
		<li>The board discussed the handling of double submissions. Current solution: general double submission ok, but not with <span class="caps">ACL</span></li>
		<li>The board discussed potential problems with having the submission deadline one week before <span class="caps">ACL</span> deadline? It was proposed to discuss this further with the program chairs and general chair.</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li><span class="caps">GCC</span>  &#8212; Jennifer Chu-Carroll has agreed to be the general conference chair</li>
	<li>PC Chairs nominated:
	<ol>
		<li>Eric Fosler-Lussier</li>
		<li>Ellen Riloff</li>
		<li>Srinivas Bangalore</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="caps">ACL</span>/<span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2014</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Bid just went out. Haifeng Wang is the coordinating committee chair.</li>
	<li>Appoint Sponsorship Committee Representative
	<ol>
		<li>We have two reps: currently Michael Gamon (2010-2012) and Patrick Pantel (2011-2013).</li>
		<li>We replace one each year &#8212; term begins in August.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2>Nomination Committee Reform</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Draft a short job description written up for each Board position. TO DO (Anoop)
	<ol>
		<li>Draft nomination letter template:</li>
		<li>The aforementioned restriction on serving in various conference capacities.</li>
		<li>The aforementioned fact that nominees are committing to three years on the Nominating Committee after their Board service, if elected.</li>
		<li>That they will need to write a candidacy statement and biosketch, and by what date.</li>
		<li>The expectation that they will attend the Board meetings that occur at the annual <span class="caps">NAACL</span> conferences, at their own expense</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>Draft initial wordings of constitution changes (circulate within the Board for comments).
	<ol>
		<li>Idea: past board members should expect 2-3 years of commitment. Members may leave after 2 years if nomcom has at least 3 members without them. This happens in practice anyway as busier members of the official nom-com committee do not contribute as much as those who can spare the time.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2>Emerging Regions Funds (was: Latin American Funds &amp; Regional Workshop Funds)</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Time frame: deadline on 3/15 and 9/15 (default point persons: David)</li>

<h2><span class="caps">SRW</span> at <span class="caps">NAACL</span>-<span class="caps">HLT</span> 2010</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Quite a bit of airtime during business meeting. <span class="caps">DISCUSSION</span>: Who is the intended audience?</li>
	<li>Hal pointed out an interesting model used at <span class="caps">ICML</span> &#8212; each first time first author student gets 3 mentors regardless of whether the paper appears in the main session</li>
	<li><span class="caps">STATUS</span>: for 2011, we&#8217;re joint with <span class="caps">ACL</span>, so the <span class="caps">ACL</span> <span class="caps">SRW</span> chair (Thamar Solorio) might something a little different. We might see how they do before making a decision for <span class="caps">NAACL</span> 2012.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="caps">NAACL</span>-<span class="caps">HLT</span> 2010</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The chair (Rebecca Hwa) summarized lessons learned to <span class="caps">ACL</span> 2011 committee.</li>
	<li>Conference logistics:
	<ol>
		<li>short papers &#8212; same deadline as long? Yes.</li>
		<li>should the authors be given an extra page to address reviewer comments? Yes.</li>
		<li>exhibits/demo track? Continue. Need proactive chair. <span class="caps">DISCUSSION</span>: Possibly merge with poster?</li>
		<li>registration fee structure: built-in member fee or separate member/non-member reg. fee? Built-in member reg. fee</li>
		<li>updating info to the authors so that they expect that they should consider the deadline for camera ready as the &#8220;public release&#8221; date.</li>
		<li>authors whose papers have been nominated best papers would like to make public this information. Fine</li>
		<li>deadline coordination with <span class="caps">ACL</span>: The chair should bring up this discussion at <span class="caps">ACL</span> Exec.</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>Student Travel Fund (2011, $6000. Default point person, Chris CB)
	<ol>

<h2>Outreach programs</h2>
<ol>
	<li><span class="caps">JHU</span> Summer School
	<ol>
		<li>2011 with budget $10,000, point person (Ted in 2010, Chris CB in 2011)</li>
		<li>2010 Current schedule: deadline April 1st, decision April 22nd. We received 23 applications to our call. We were also willing to consider up to 10 &#8220;near miss&#8221; students from the <span class="caps">JHU</span> summer workshop application process, but only 2 of them expressed interest in the scholarship program (and so they were added to the pool, bringing the total number of applications evaluated to 25). Seven students were funded, six with &#8220;full&#8221; scholarships for travel, registration and lodging, and one local student got a registration only scholarship.</li>
		<li>Fate of videos from 2010? Did we fund that?? Were they recorded, and will they be made available?</li>
		<li>Call for scholarship applications posted to corpora, ir-list, naacl list, naacl-latin-america list Feb 26. Call also posted on web page by Anoop.</li>
		<li>Five of seven students responded to our survey, results mailed to board members July 19. <span class="caps">TDP</span></li>
		<li>Fate of videos from 2008 and 2009 (recorded but not distributed) and plans for 2010. Updated by Ted : As of Feb 21 <span class="caps">CCB</span> has uploaded some of the video content from summer 2009, and has replaced Jason E. as <span class="caps">JHU</span> contact person.</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li><span class="caps">NACLO</span> (north american computational linguistics olympiad &#8212; for high schoolers, budget $5000)
	<ol>
		<li>[ChrisM: Unless we&#8217;re taking a more pro-active role, I&#8217;m not sure that this needs a point person.  Up until now, I&#8217;ve just written a check every year, and the organizers have dealt with contacting <span class="caps">NLP</span> people and encouraging them to sign up to host competitions, etc.]</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li><span class="caps">LSA</span> Linguistic Institute 2011
	<ol>
		<li><span class="caps">STATUS</span> &#8212; Thanks to Anoop Sarkar and Kristina Toutanova for the ad design.</li>
		<li>We agreed to sponsor the program at $10K.</li>
		<li>We will not be selecting graduate student fellowships. We will sponsor courses.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2>Sponsorship representatives</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Background: overall organization is that there is an <span class="caps">ACL</span>-wide sponsorship committee that consists of two regional representatives from each chapter. Each representative serves for two years. The terms are staggered so that we need to recommend one person every year.</li>
	<li><span class="caps">STATUS</span>:
	<ol>
		<li>Our current two representatives are: Srini Bangalore (2009-2011) and Michael Gamon (2010-2012). Srini will be replaced by Patrick Pantel this July.</li>
		<li>Past representatives Christy Doran (2009-2010).</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2>Industry Relations</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Point person: Kristina</li>
	<li>Discussion of plans for 2011 or 2012.
	<ol>
		<li>Ron Kaplan was a keynote speaker at Text Analytics (2010). Maybe there is some future ties to be made there?</li>
		<li>Recruit technology showcase with exhibitions and demos?</li>
		<li>Set up spaces for companies to recruit?</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li><span class="caps">STATUS</span>:
	<ol>
		<li><span class="caps">NAACL</span> had an industrial panel at <span class="caps">NAACL</span>-<span class="caps">HLT</span> 2010</li>
		<li>Some feedback from business meeting: people would like to see more involvement from industry members who are not affiliated with a large research lab</li>
	</ol></li>
