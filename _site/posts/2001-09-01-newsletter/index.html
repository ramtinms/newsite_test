<h2 id="upcoming-elections">Upcoming Elections</h2>

<p>You will soon be receiving mail from the Nominating Committee
regarding the elections for the 2002 NAACL Board. The nominating
committee will propose an initial slate of candidates, to which the
membership can nominate additional candidates. Nominations are needed
for almost every position:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chair</li>
  <li>Secretary</li>
  <li>Treasurer</li>
  <li>Two members of the executive board (bringing us to our final state of four members with staggered terms)</li>
</ul>

<p>A list of the current NAACL officers and their terms, as well as the
rules for term-limits as specified in our constitution, are at the
NAACL web site.</p>

<h2 id="elections-constitutional-amendments-and-member-survey">2000 Elections, Constitutional Amendments, and Member Survey</h2>

<p>Last fall we ran our first elections. The nominating committee
suggested nine candidates for two positions on the executive board,
five of whom agreed to be nominated.  An additional nomination came
from the NAACL membership.  The vote was conducted electronically,
using new software developed at ISI.  Thanks very much to Uli Germann
for making this happen. The election exposed some problems with the
current constitution, so the membership was also asked to vote on two
amendments.  890 emails were sent, resulting in 285 votes being cast.
The new executive board members are Graeme Hirst and Dan Jurafsky,
replacing Sandra Carberry, Ed Hovy, and Marilyn Walker (the NAACL
“start-up” committee, who we thank very much for their hard work
before and during the first year of the chapter).  The changes to the
constitution were approved with wide majorities and can be found on
our website (http://www.naacl.org).</p>

<p>We also used this opportunity to ask our members to fill in a survey,
the highlights of which are shown below.  Thanks to everyone who took
the time to vote and respond to our survey.  Please feel free to send
us further comments and suggestions at any time.</p>

<p>Best Time for NAACL?
    69 February/March/April/May
    53 during the summer
    52 September/October/November
    48 I have no preference</p>

<p>How Often Should NAACL Be Held?
   215 every year that there is no (international) ACL or COLING in North America</p>

<p>Preferred Venue?
    83 doesn’t matter
    58 a university
    47 hotel and university
    35 a hotel</p>

<p>What Makes You Go?
   123 distance from other conferences
    70 low cost of venue</p>

<p>Conferences Attended:
   158 NAACL 2001 (Pittsburgh, June 2001)
   127 ANLP/NAACL 2000 (Seattle, June 2000)
    95 ACL 2001 (France, July 2001)
    42 ACL 2000 (Hong Kong, October 2000)</p>

<p>In addition, we received many useful comments, which are now posted on
the web.</p>

<h2 id="naacl-01-the-2nd-meeting-of-naacl-pittsburgh-pa-june-2001">NAACL-01, the 2nd Meeting of NAACL, Pittsburgh, PA, June 2001</h2>

<p>The NAACL-01 conference (our first solo conference) was extremely
successful.  We attracted approximately 500 people, have heard very
positive feedback, and expect a financial surplus. The program
included 31 papers (acceptance rate of 28%, mostly from North
America), 3 invited speakers, a student research workshop, 4 other
workshops, co-location with EMNLP, 4 tutorials, 27 demonstrations, and
a full-day exhibit program.  Reports from all of the conference chairs
will be archived, and are available upon request.  The conference
website is still active, and can be found at
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ref/naacl2001.html.  Thanks to Lori Levin
(General Chair), Alon Lavie (Local Arrangements Chair), Kevin Knight
(PC Chair), the NAACL-01 subchairs, and of course the membership, for
making the conference such a success.</p>

<h2 id="executive-committee-meeting-june-2001">Executive Committee Meeting, June 2001</h2>

<p>The NAACL Executive Committee met on June 2, 2001, at the NAACL
conference in Pittsburgh, PA. The agenda included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reports from NAACL Officers</li>
  <li>NAACL-01 Report</li>
  <li>ACL-02/NAACL-02 Report</li>
  <li>NAACL-03/HLT Discussion</li>
  <li>Discussion of Past and Upcoming Elections</li>
  <li>Constitutional Issues</li>
  <li>Discussion of Policies</li>
  <li>Web/Email Issues</li>
  <li>Formulation of Exec Job Descriptions</li>
  <li>Discussion of New Initiatives</li>
</ul>

<p>The minutes of this meeting are now available on the NAACL webpage
(http://www.naacl.org).</p>

<h2 id="acl-02">ACL-02</h2>

<p>Next year we will be co-hosting the (international) ACL meeting, which
will be held in Philadelphia, PA, July 2002.  Martha Palmer (who will
be retiring from the NAACL board this year) is the Local Arrangements
Chair.</p>

<h2 id="naacl-03-and-possible-merger-with-hlt">NAACL-03 and possible merger with HLT</h2>

<p>The planning of the NAACL-03 conference has begun.  Since the spring,
we have been discussing the possibility of a trial merger and/or
co-location of the NAACL and the Human Language Technology (HLT)
conferences.  The NAACL board is eager to reach out to the speech and
IR communities, and also wants to avoid conference proliferation. Ed
Hovy has been negotiating a final “Memorandum of Understanding”
between NAACL and the other involved parties.</p>

<h2 id="proposed-schedule-of-naacl-eacl-and-acl-meetings">Proposed Schedule of NAACL, EACL, and ACL Meetings</h2>

<p>With the internationalization of the ACL, the following meeting
schedule has been adopted by the ACL executive.  Every 3 years, ACL
rotates between North America, Asia, and Europe.  As a result, EACL is
now held twice every 3 years (rather than every other year).  NAACL
will likely be held every year that there is no ACL or Coling in
N. America.</p>

<pre><code>2002    ACL (NAACL)        Philadelphia     
2003    ACL                Japan         
        NAACL              N. America, possibly with HLT
        EACL               Europe         
2004    ACL (EACL)         Europe         
        NAACL              Possibly omitted/merged due to Coling
2005    ACL (NAACL)        North America 
2006    ACL                Asia 
        NAACL              North America 
        EACL               Europe
etc.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="new-initiatives">New Initiatives</h2>

<p>To date, the bulk of our efforts have involved setting up the NAACL
organization.  Now that that process is largely completed, it is time
to turn to starting up some new programs.  Since we anticipate having
some money in the bank, we are currently discussing ways to put the
funds to good use.  One of the recurring themes in the responses to
our survey was the desire for more educational activities.  As a
result, we are currently exploring several possibilities for
sponsoring a summer school in 2002.</p>
