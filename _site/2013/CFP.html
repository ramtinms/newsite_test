<h1>Call for Papers for NAACL HLT 2013<br />
June 9 - 14, 2013  Atlanta, Georgia<br />
http://naacl.org    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         #naacl2013</h1>
 
<p>NAACL is pleased to announce the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics - Human Language Technologies (NAACL HLT) 2013 conference. The conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines working towards enabling intelligent systems to interact with humans using natural language, and towards enhancing human-human communication through services such as speech recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval, text summarization, and information extraction. NAACL HLT 2013 will feature long papers, short papers, demonstrations, and a doctoral consortium, as well as associated tutorials and workshops.</p>
 
<p>The conference invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of automated language processing, including language resources. The short paper format may also be appropriate for a small, focused contribution, a work in progress, a negative result, an opinion piece or an interesting application nugget.</p>
 
<p>Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas:</p>
<ul> 
<li> Phonology and Morphology, Word Segmentation</li>
 <li> Syntax, Tagging, Chunking and Parsing</li>
 <li> Semantics</li>
 <li> Multimodal Natural Language Processing</li>
 <li> Discourse, Dialogue, and Pragmatics</li>
 <li> Other Aspects of Computational Linguistics</li>
 <li> Summarization</li>

<h2>Submissions</h2>
 
<h3>LONG PAPERS:</h3>
<p>NAACL HLT 2013 submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. The long paper deadline is December 10, 2012 by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8). Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, thoroughness, significance, contributions to research resources, and replicability. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.</p>
 
<p>Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus two (2) extra pages for references; final versions should take into account reviewers' comments. Papers will be presented orally or as a poster presentation as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and those presented as poster presentations.</p>
 
 
<h3>SHORT PAPERS:</h3>
 
<p>NAACL HLT 2013 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. The short paper deadline this year is also December 10, 2012 by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8). Characteristics of past short papers include:</p>
 <ul>
 <li> A small, focused contribution</li>
 <li> Work in progress</li>
 <li> A negative result</li>
 <li> An opinion piece</li>
 <li> An interesting application nugget</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions, and will be given four (4) pages in the proceedings, plus up to two (2) extra pages for references. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and those presented as poster presentations. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members.</p>
 
<h3>ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION:</h3>
 
<p>Submission is electronic using the Softconf submission software; more information will be available on the NAACL 2013 webpage and via #naacl2013 on Twitter.</p>
 
<h3>FORMAT:</h3>
 
<p>Long paper submissions should follow the two-column format of NAACL HLT 2013 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus two (2) extra pages for references. Short paper submissions should also follow the two-column format of NAACL HLT 2013 proceedings, and should not exceed four (4) pages including references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's conference. Submissions must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in the style files, and they must be electronic in PDF.  Please see naaclhlt2013.pdf for detailed formatting instructions.  These page limits must be strictly observed.</p>
 
<p>As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. In addition, please do not post your submissions on the web until after the review process is complete.</p>
 
<h3>MULTIPLE-SUBMISSION POLICY:</h3>
 
<p>Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at NAACL HLT 2013 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.</p>
 
<p>Authors submitting more than one paper to NAACL HLT must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly (> 50%) with each other in content or results. Authors should not submit short and long versions of papers with substantial overlap in their original contributions.</p>
