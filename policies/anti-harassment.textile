title: NAACL Conference Anti-Harassment Policy
root: ../
---

The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the aims and goals of a NAACL conference. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. For these reasons, NAACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our events and in our programs.

Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any NAACL conference. This includes: speech or behavior (including in public presentations and on-line discourse) that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person's participation or opportunity for participation in the conference. We aim for NAACL conferences to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities.  In addition, any participant who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any current member of the "NAACL Board":http://naacl.org/officers/index.html or contact Priscilla Rasmussen, who is usually available at the registration desk of the conference. Please be assured that if you approach us, your concerns will be kept in strict confidence, and we will consult with you on any actions taken.

h3. Implementation

This policy should be posted prominently on all conference and workshop webpages, with a notice of a list of people who can be contacted by community members with concerns.  In case of a formal complaint, the contacted NAACL representative(s) will first speak to all parties involved to try to resolve the issue -- without presupposition of guilt.

h3. Background

This policy was developed by the NAACL Board with reference to similar policies adopted at many of our peer professional organizations (including "SIGPLAN's":http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Anti-harassment and those of other ACM SIGs).
